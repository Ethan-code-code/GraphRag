The first article of the bill stipulated the replacement of the text of Article (25) of Law No. (106) of 2013, such that the Council of Ministers <orig>مجلس الوزراء</orig>, upon the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs <orig>وزير الخارجية</orig>, shall be the competent authority to issue the necessary resolutions to implement the aforementioned Security Council <orig>مجلس الأمن</orig> resolutions. This includes resolutions for listing and delisting, freezing funds and other assets, and prohibiting dealings with natural or legal persons. The text also stipulated that these resolutions shall be effective from the date of their issuance, to prevent any delay that might undermine their content or limit their effect. The executive regulations have been entrusted with outlining the rules for publishing or making these resolutions available, the provisions for grievances against them, the regulations governing the management of frozen funds and assets, and the authorization to release specific amounts or values thereof to cover necessary living expenses or essential financial obligations, ensuring the legitimate use of such funds within the limits imposed by necessity.

The text has permitted the Council of Ministers <orig>مجلس الوزراء</orig> to delegate one of the ministers to apply the provisions of this article, enabling the administration to act swiftly and facilitating the resolution of requests. It also allowed the delegated minister, unless otherwise stipulated, to entrust what has been delegated to him to a specialized committee, in accordance with the regulations it sets, thereby assigning the implementation of tasks to a clear and specific body.

Thus, this text has surrounded the implementation of Security Council <orig>مجلس الأمن</orig> resolutions with an integrated legal framework that balances the requirements of international commitment with the demands of constitutional guarantees. It ensures individuals' right to grievance, access to information, and the right to request authorization to cover necessary expenses, which in its entirety supports the system for combating terrorism and its financing and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction on a legal basis.

The bill, in its second article, also added a new article numbered (33 bis), which stipulates a penal sanction of a fine for anyone who violates the resolutions of the Council of Ministers <orig>مجلس الوزراء</orig> issued pursuant to Article (25), with the fine ranging between ten thousand and five hundred thousand Dinars <orig>دينار</orig> for each violation.

The second paragraph of the article affirmed that this does not prejudice the powers of regulatory authorities to impose penalties or administrative measures on financial institutions or designated non-financial businesses and professions as specified in Article (15) of the same law.

To ensure the continuity of the frameworks in place in the State regarding the implementation of United Nations Security Council <orig>مجلس الأمن التابع للأمم المتحدة</orig> resolutions, particularly the special committee formed under Ministerial Resolution No. (8) of 2025, the third article of this decree-law has stipulated that the regulations and resolutions issued before its entry into force shall remain in effect, unless amended or repealed, and provided they do not conflict with its provisions.

The bill concluded with the fourth article, which stipulated that the Prime Minister <orig>رئيس مجلس الوزراء</orig> and the Ministers—each within their respective jurisdictions—are charged with its implementation, and that it shall come into force from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>.

## Amending the Penal Code promulgated by Law No. 16 of 1960

- Having reviewed the Constitution,
- And the Amiri Order issued on 2 Dhul-Qa'dah 1445 H, corresponding to 10 May 2024 AD,
- And the Penal Code promulgated by Law No. (16) of 1960, and its amending laws,

### (Article One)
Two new articles, numbered (259 bis) and (259 bis A), shall be added to the aforementioned Penal Code, with the following text:

**Article (259 bis)**
Whoever prints, publishes, broadcasts, promotes, sells, offers for sale, or leaks, by any means, the questions or answers of governmental or non-governmental education examinations for the intermediate or secondary stages, with the intent to cheat or facilitate cheating, disrupt the general order of examinations, or affect the validity and integrity of their results, shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of not less than two years and not more than five years, and a fine of not less than one thousand dinars and not more than five thousand dinars, or by one of these two penalties.

In all cases, the seized items used in the commission of the crime shall be confiscated.
The acts mentioned in the first paragraph shall not be considered a crime if they involve sample questions or previous answers used for the purpose of training or preparing for examinations.

Issued at Seif Palace on: 4 Muharram 1447 H
Corresponding to: 29 June 2025 AD# Explanatory Memorandum
## To Decree-Law No. 77 of 2025
## Amending the Penal Code Promulgated
## by Law No. 16 of 1960

Given the urgent need to protect the integrity of the educational process in the intermediate and secondary stages, and to ensure fairness in assessment and prevent any manipulation that could affect the academic, professional, and practical future of students, or disrupt the examination system; and given the importance of this in ensuring the standardization and confidentiality of assessments, as publishing or circulating examinations among students—before their scheduled time—directly affects the credibility of the results and does not reflect the true reality of the educational performance level.

And to establish effective criminal protection for the integrity of intermediate and secondary education examinations, given the critical importance of these examinations in determining the educational path of students, and as they form a basis for evaluating school performance and the credibility of the entire educational system, and in light of the observed dangerous practices related to the leaking of questions or the dissemination of answers, which threaten educational justice, undermine public confidence in educational outcomes, and at the same time require the imposition of an appropriate penalty for tampering with their results.
Within the framework of efforts aimed at enhancing the legislative protection for the integrity of the educational process in its public and private intermediate and secondary stages, combating manifestations of cheating or manipulation that threaten the quality of education, and entrenching the values of equality, discipline, and merit in the educational and national community, and for all the foregoing, the need has arisen for a legislative regulation that addresses and curtails the phenomenon of cheating and examination leaks, so as to ensure the integrity of the educational process.
And whereas the Amiri Order <orig>الأمر الأميري</orig> was issued on 10/5/2024, and Article (4) thereof stipulated that laws shall be issued by decree-laws, therefore, the present draft decree-law has been prepared to amend the Penal Code <orig>قانون الجزاء</orig> issued by Law No. 16 of 1960. The first article of this draft provides for the addition of two new articles to the aforementioned Penal Code <orig>قانون الجزاء</orig>, numbered (259 bis, 259 bis A).
Article (259 bis) criminalizes any act that includes printing, publishing, broadcasting, disseminating, selling, offering for sale, or leaking questions or answers of public or private intermediate or secondary education examinations, by any means whatsoever, when these acts are coupled with the intent to cheat, facilitate cheating, disrupt the examination system, or affect its validity and integrity. It stipulates a penalty for anyone who commits any of these acts of imprisonment for a term of not less than two years and not more than five years, and a fine of not less than one thousand dinars <orig>دينار</orig> and not more than five thousand dinars <orig>دينار</orig>, or one of these two penalties. This text also imposes a stricter penalty if the perpetrator of these acts is among the persons responsible for supervising, preparing, setting, organizing, transporting, delivering, or safeguarding these examinations, with the judgment mandating the confiscation of the tools or means used in committing the crime. It sets the penalty here as imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years, and a fine of not less than five thousand dinars <orig>دينار</orig> and not more than ten thousand dinars <orig>دينار</orig>, or one of these two penalties, along with the confiscation of the seized items used in committing the crime.
To distinguish between lawful and criminal acts, the text of this article excludes from the scope of criminalization previous models of questions and answers used for the purposes of training or preparation for examinations, thereby achieving a balance between the requirements of deterrence and the protection of legitimate educational efforts.
As for Article (259 bis A), it criminalizes another equally serious behavior, which is the unlawful modification of answers or grades awarded to students in the aforementioned education examinations. It stipulates a penalty for the perpetrator of imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years, and a fine of not less than five thousand dinars <orig>دينار</orig> and not more than ten thousand dinars <orig>دينار</orig>, or one of these two penalties, as this act contradicts professional integrity, represents a direct assault on the results of educational assessment, and has a grave impact on equal opportunity and educational justice. The penalty is stiffened if the offender is one of the employees assigned to the process of correcting, evaluating, or recording grades, becoming imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, and a fine of not less than five thousand dinars <orig>دينار</orig> and not more than twenty thousand dinars <orig>دينار</orig>, or one of these two penalties.
Article Two of the present draft decree-law obligates the Prime Minister <orig>رئيس مجلس الوزراء</orig> and the Ministers, each within their respective jurisdictions, to implement this decree-law, and specifies its effective date as the date of its publication in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>.

1- That place or the other place constitutes a permanent establishment for that entity or for the closely related entity.
2- The overall activity resulting from the combined activities carried on by the two entities at the same place, or at two different places within the State, is not of a preparatory or auxiliary character, and provided that these combined activities constitute complementary functions of a cohesive business operation.
An establishment shall be considered a permanent establishment in any of the following cases:
1- A place of business, or what is deemed as such, located within a jurisdiction and treated as a permanent establishment under an effective tax agreement, provided that such jurisdiction imposes a tax on the income attributable to that place, in accordance with provisions similar to those of the "Business Profits" article of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital.
2- A place of business, or what is deemed as such, located in a jurisdiction that, under its domestic legislation, imposes a tax on the income attributable to it on a net basis and in a manner similar to that in which tax is imposed on its tax residents, in the absence of an effective tax agreement.

2- Net gains from investments, realized and unrealized, that are included in the statement of profit or loss within the consolidated financial statements, in addition to income or gains that are presented separately as exceptional or non-recurring items in the consolidated financial statements. "Net gains from investments" means the result of deducting investment losses from investment gains, provided that the result is not less than zero, in the event that investment gains and investment losses are listed separately in the statement of profit and loss within the consolidated financial statements for a specific tax period.
3- Revenues of an Excluded Entity <orig>الكيان المستبعد</orig>, when that entity is part of a Multinational Enterprise Group <orig>مجموعة الكيانات متعددة الجنسيات</orig>, for the purposes of the revenue threshold test only.
Transactions conducted within the Multinational Enterprise Group <orig>مجموعة الكيانات متعددة الجنسيات</orig> shall be excluded from the calculation of the revenue threshold.
Revenues may not be reduced by the amounts attributable to minority interest holders.
If different types of revenues are listed separately in the statement of profit or loss within the consolidated financial statements, those revenues must be aggregated for the purpose of applying the revenue threshold test.
If a Multinational Enterprise Group <orig>مجموعة الكيانات متعددة الجنسيات</orig> has not prepared consolidated financial statements, its annual revenues shall be determined in accordance with the deemed consolidation test by calculating the assets, liabilities, income, expenses, and cash flows on an item-by-item basis for all entities in which the Ultimate Parent Entity <orig>الكيان الأم النهائي</orig> holds a controlling interest.
If a Multinational Enterprise Group <orig>مجموعة الكيانات متعددة الجنسيات</orig> does not have consolidated financial statements for any of the four tax periods preceding the tested tax period because the constituent entities of the Multinational Enterprise Group <orig>مجموعة الكيانات متعددة الجنسيات</orig> were recently established, the provisions of the Law shall apply starting from the third tax period for which consolidated financial statements have been prepared, provided that the revenue threshold was met during the two tax periods preceding that period.
If any of the preceding tax periods is less than or more than (12) months, the revenue threshold shall be recalculated on a pro-rata basis to determine the revenue threshold for that period, in accordance with the following formula:

<table>
| | | |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Revenue Threshold | 750,000,000 | Number of months in the tax period |

The State or any jurisdiction shall be the location of an entity in accordance with the following controls:

1- The location of a non-flow-through entity is determined as follows:
a) If the entity is a tax resident in a state or jurisdiction based on its place of management, place of creation, or any similar criteria, its location is considered to be in that state or jurisdiction.
b) In other cases, its location is considered to be in the state or jurisdiction in which it was created.

2- The location of a flow-through entity is determined as follows:
a) If the entity is an Ultimate Parent Entity of a Multinational Enterprise Group, or is subject to the application of an Income Inclusion Rule, its location is considered to be in the state or jurisdiction in which it was created.
b) In other cases, it is treated as a stateless entity.

3- The location of a Permanent Establishment is determined as follows:
a) If the Permanent Establishment is identified in accordance with clause (1) of the fourth paragraph of Article (2) of these Regulations, its location is considered to be in the jurisdiction where it is treated as a permanent establishment and is subject to tax therein under an applicable tax treaty.
b) If the Permanent Establishment is identified in accordance with clause (2) of the fourth paragraph of Article (2) of these Regulations, its location is considered to be in the jurisdiction where it is subject to tax on its net income based on its place of business or its equivalent.
c) If the Permanent Establishment is identified in accordance with clause (3) of the fourth paragraph of Article (2) of these Regulations, its location is considered to be in the jurisdiction where it is situated.

4- If a Constituent Entity is located in more than one jurisdiction, its location is determined as follows:
a- If the entity is located in the State and in another jurisdiction and there is an applicable tax treaty between them, its location is considered to be in the state or jurisdiction where it is deemed a resident for the purposes of that tax treaty. If that treaty requires the competent authorities to reach a mutual agreement on the deemed tax residency of the Constituent Entity for its purposes and no agreement is reached, or if the tax treaty does not grant tax relief or exemptions because the Constituent Entity is considered a tax resident in both contracting states, the provisions of the following sub-clause shall apply:
b- If no tax treaty applies, its location is determined as follows:
1. Its location is considered to be in the state or jurisdiction where it paid the greater amount of Covered Taxes for the fiscal year, without calculating taxes paid under a controlled foreign corporation tax regime.
2. If the amount of Covered Taxes paid in both jurisdictions is equal, or is zero, its location is considered to be in the state or jurisdiction where it has the higher amount of Substance-Based Income Exclusion, calculated separately on an entity basis in accordance with the provisions of Article (43) of these Regulations.
3. If the amount of the Substance-Based Income Exclusion is equal in both jurisdictions, or is zero, it is considered a stateless Constituent Entity, unless it is the Ultimate Parent Entity of the Multinational Enterprise Group, in which case its location is considered to be in the state or jurisdiction in which it was created.
5- The Substance-Based Income Exclusion is calculated on a separate basis, as if the entity in question were the only Constituent Entity of the Multinational Enterprise Group in the state or jurisdiction.
6- If a Constituent Entity changes its location during the tax period, its location is considered to be in the state or jurisdiction where it was located on the first day of that tax period.

## Article (8)
## Imposition and Liability of Tax

Tax shall be imposed on the taxable entities referred to in Article (4) of these Regulations on the taxable income for each tax period.

For the purpose of imposing the tax, the total taxable income is taken into account regardless of the percentage of ownership interests in the subject entity held directly or indirectly by the Ultimate Parent Entity of the Multinational Enterprise Group.

# Article (23)
## Qualified Refundable Tax Credits and Marketable Transferable Tax Credits

The amount of a non-qualified refundable tax credit, a non-transferable marketable tax credit, or a non-refundable tax credit that passes through a fiscally transparent entity <orig>كيان شفاف ضريبياً</orig> to the owner shall not be treated as Pillar Two Income or Loss, but rather as a reduction in the owner's Adjusted Covered Taxes, unless that credit constitutes a Qualified Flow-through Tax Benefit <orig>ميزة ضريبية متدفقة مؤهلة</orig>.

    a) The first day of the fiscal year in which the election began to apply.
    b) The date of acquisition of the asset or incurrence of the liability.
3- If the election referred to in this Article is revoked, the Pillar Two Income or Loss of the Constituent Entities must be adjusted by the amount of the difference between the fair value of the asset or liability and its carrying amount determined at the beginning of the fiscal year in which the revocation takes effect.

# Article (25)
## Election to Spread Capital Gains Over Five Tax Periods

If a net gain arises from the disposal of tangible assets in the State during a tax period, a designated Constituent Entity may make an election for a tax period in the State to adjust the Pillar Two Income or Loss for each preceding tax period within the look-back period, in accordance with the provisions of clauses (2) and (3) of the fourth paragraph of this Article, with any remaining adjusted asset gains spread over the look-back period in the manner described in clause (4) of the same paragraph.

For the purposes of applying the provisions of this Article, the "look-back period" means the tax period in which the election is made, in addition to the four preceding tax periods.

When an election is made under this Article, the Effective Tax Rate and any Top-up Tax, if any, for any preceding tax period must be recalculated pursuant to the first paragraph of Article (47) of these Regulations.

When an election is made under this Article, the following shall be observed:
1- Covered Taxes attributable to the net asset gains or net asset losses in the election tax period shall be excluded from the calculation of Adjusted Covered Taxes.
2- The total asset gains in the election tax period shall be carried back to the earliest loss tax period and offset proportionally against any net asset losses of any Constituent Entity located in that State that is a member of the same Multinational Enterprise Group.
3- If the adjusted asset gains in any given loss tax period exceed the total net asset losses of all Constituent Entities located in the State, the adjusted asset gains shall be carried forward to the next loss period, if any, and applied proportionally against any net asset losses of any Constituent Entity located in the State.
4- Any remaining adjusted asset gains after applying the provisions of clauses (2) and (3) of this paragraph shall be distributed equally to each tax period within the look-back period. The asset gains allocated to the relevant tax period must be included in the calculation of the Pillar Two Income or Loss of the Constituent Entity located in the State during that tax period, in accordance with the following formula:

<table_caption>Formula for Allocating Asset Gains for Year X</table_caption>
<table>
| | |
|:---|:---|
| Asset Gains Allocated for Year X | = |
| | Net Asset Gains of the Specified Constituent Entity in the Election Period |
| | --- |
| | Net Asset Gains of all Specified Constituent Entities in the Election Period |
</table>

The specified Constituent Entity means the Constituent Entity that realized net asset gains during the election tax period and was located in the State in the relevant tax period. If there is no specified Constituent Entity during a relevant tax period, the adjusted asset gains allocated to that tax period shall be distributed equally among all Constituent Entities located in the State during that tax period.

Net asset gains means the net gain resulting from the disposal of local tangible assets by a Constituent Entity located in the State for which the election was made, excluding any gain or loss from the transfer of assets to another member of the Group.

Net asset loss means the net loss resulting from the disposal of local tangible assets by that Constituent Entity in that tax period, excluding any gain or loss from the transfer of assets to another member of the Group. The amount of the net asset loss must be reduced by the amount of net asset gain or adjusted asset gain that is set off against this loss as a result of a previous election made.

Loss tax period means: a tax period in the look-back period in which there is a net asset loss for a Constituent Entity in that State, and the total amount of net asset losses for all Constituent Entities exceeds the total amount of their net asset gains.

# Article (26)
## Intra-Group Financing Arrangements

The provisions of this Article shall apply when a low-taxed Constituent Entity in the State incurs an expense resulting from an intra-group financing arrangement obtained from a high-taxed counterparty.

When calculating the Pillar Two Income or Loss of a low-taxed Constituent Entity, that entity must exclude any expense resulting from an intra-group financing arrangement, whenever it is reasonable to expect that such arrangement, during its term, will lead to an increase in the amount of expenses recognized when calculating the Pillar Two Income or Loss of that entity, without a corresponding increase in the taxable income of the high-taxed counterparty.

Intra-group financing arrangements means any arrangement entered into between two or more members of a Multinational Enterprise Group where the high-taxed counterparty, directly or indirectly, provides financing or credit or otherwise invests in a low-taxed entity.

Low-tax jurisdiction means a jurisdiction in which a Multinational Enterprise Group has net Pillar Two Income for a tax period and is subject to an Effective Tax Rate in that period that is less than the Minimum Tax Rate.

2- Any returns due to policyholders that are not included in the net financial accounting income or loss must be included in the calculation of Pillar Two Income or Loss to the extent that the corresponding increase or decrease in the liability to policyholders is reflected in its net financial accounting income or loss.

# Article (29)
## Additional Tier 1 Capital and Restricted Tier 1 Capital
Amounts recognized as a reduction in the equity of a Constituent Entity and attributable to distributions paid or payable in respect of Additional Tier 1 Capital or Restricted Tier 1 Capital issued by that entity shall be treated as an expense when calculating the Pillar Two Income or Loss of that entity.
Amounts recognized as an increase in the equity of a Constituent Entity and attributable to distributions received or receivable in respect of Additional Tier 1 Capital or Restricted Tier 1 Capital held by the Constituent Entity shall be treated as income when calculating the Pillar Two Income or Loss of that entity.

If the Permanent Establishment <orig>المنشأة الدائمة</orig> does not have separate financial accounts, the net financial accounting income or loss shall be calculated based on the amount that would have been included in such accounts had they been prepared separately and in accordance with the accounting standard used in preparing the consolidated financial statements of the Ultimate Parent Entity <orig>الكيان الأم النهائي</orig>.
The net financial accounting income or loss of this Permanent Establishment <orig>المنشأة الدائمة</orig> must be adjusted as follows:
1- For the Permanent Establishment <orig>المنشأة الدائمة</orig> referred to in items (1) and (2) of the fourth paragraph of Article (2), the adjustment must be made to include only the amounts and items of income and expense attributable to that Permanent Establishment <orig>المنشأة الدائمة</orig> in accordance with the applicable tax treaty or the domestic law of the jurisdiction in which it is located, regardless of the amount of income subject to tax or the amount of expenses deductible for tax purposes in that jurisdiction.
2- For the Permanent Establishment <orig>المنشأة الدائمة</orig> referred to in item (3) of the fourth paragraph of Article (2), the adjustment must be made to include only the amounts and items of income and expense that would have been attributable to that Permanent Establishment <orig>المنشأة الدائمة</orig> in accordance with the provisions of the "Business Profits" article of the Model Tax Convention issued by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
3- If the Constituent Entity <orig>الكيان المشارك</orig> is considered a Permanent Establishment <orig>المنشأة الدائمة</orig> in accordance with item (4) of the fourth paragraph of Article (2), the income used in calculating the net financial accounting income or loss shall be the domestic income in the jurisdiction where the Main Entity <orig>الكيان الرئيسي</orig> is located that is attributable to operations conducted outside that jurisdiction. The expenses used in calculating the net financial accounting income or loss shall be equal to those expenses that were not deducted for tax purposes in the jurisdiction where the Main Entity <orig>الكيان الرئيسي</orig> is located and that are attributable to those operations.
The net accounting income or loss of the Permanent Establishment <orig>المنشأة الدائمة</orig> shall not be taken into account when determining the Pillar Two income or loss <orig>دخل أو خسارة الركيزة الثانية</orig> of the Main Entity <orig>الكيان الرئيسي</orig>, unless otherwise provided in the fifth and sixth paragraphs of this Article.
The Pillar Two loss <orig>خسارة الركيزة الثانية</orig> of the Permanent Establishment <orig>المنشأة الدائمة</orig> shall be treated as an expense of the Main Entity <orig>الكيان الرئيسي</orig>, not of the Permanent Establishment <orig>المنشأة الدائمة</orig>, for the purposes of calculating the Pillar Two income or loss <orig>دخل أو خسارة الركيزة الثانية</orig> of that Main Entity <orig>الكيان الرئيسي</orig>, to the extent that the loss of the Permanent Establishment <orig>المنشأة الدائمة</orig> is treated as an expense in calculating the domestic taxable income of that Main Entity <orig>الكيان الرئيسي</orig> and has not been set off against an item of income subject to tax under the laws of both the jurisdiction of the Main Entity <orig>الكيان الرئيسي</orig> and the jurisdiction of the Permanent Establishment <orig>المنشأة الدائمة</orig>.
The Pillar Two income <orig>دخل الركيزة الثانية</orig> subsequently generated by the Permanent Establishment <orig>المنشأة الدائمة</orig> must be treated as Pillar Two income <orig>دخل الركيزة الثانية</orig> of the Main Entity <orig>الكيان الرئيسي</orig> and not of the Permanent Establishment <orig>المنشأة الدائمة</orig>, up to the amount of the Pillar Two loss <orig>خسارة الركيزة الثانية</orig> that was previously treated as an expense of the Main Entity <orig>الكيان الرئيسي</orig>.

## Article (32)
### Allocation of Income or Loss from a Pass-through Entity
The net accounting income or loss of a Constituent Entity <orig>الكيان المشارك</orig> that is a Pass-through Entity <orig>كيان يمرر الدخل</orig> shall be allocated as follows:
1- If the Pass-through Entity <orig>الكيان الذي يمرر الدخل</orig> carries on a business wholly or partly through a Permanent Establishment <orig>منشأة دائمة</orig>, the net financial accounting income or loss of the entity must be allocated to that Permanent Establishment <orig>المنشأة الدائمة</orig> in accordance with Article (31) of these Regulations.
2- If the Pass-through Entity <orig>الكيان الذي يمرر الدخل</orig> is a Tax Transparent Entity <orig>كياناً شفافاً ضريبياً</orig> and not an Ultimate Parent Entity <orig>كياناً أمّاً نهائياً</orig>, any remaining net financial accounting income or loss after applying item (1) of this paragraph must be allocated to the owners of the Constituent Entity <orig>الكيان المشارك</orig> according to their ownership interests.
3- If the Pass-through Entity <orig>الكيان الذي يمرر الدخل</orig> is a Tax Transparent Entity <orig>كياناً شفافاً ضريبياً</orig> and is an Ultimate Parent Entity <orig>كياناً أمّاً نهائياً</orig> or a Reverse Hybrid Entity <orig>كيان هجين عكسي</orig>, any remaining net financial accounting income or loss after applying item (1) of this paragraph must be allocated to that entity.
This shall be done separately for each ownership interest in the Pass-through Entity <orig>الكيان الذي يمرر الدخل</orig>.
The net financial accounting income or loss of the Pass-through Entity <orig>الكيان الذي يمرر الدخل</orig> shall, before the allocation referred to in the first paragraph of this Article, be reduced by the amount allocable to the owners of the entity who are not members of the Multinational Enterprise Group <orig>مجموعة الكيانات متعددة الجنسيات</orig> and who hold ownership interests in that entity directly or indirectly through a tax transparent structure, with the following exceptions to the application of the provisions of this paragraph:
1- The Ultimate Parent Entity <orig>الكيان الأم النهائي</orig> that is a Pass-through Entity <orig>كيان يمرر الدخل</orig>.
2- Any Pass-through Entity <orig>كيان يمرر الدخل</orig> owned directly by an Ultimate Parent Entity <orig>كيان أم نهائي</orig> that is a Pass-through Entity <orig>كياناً يمرر الدخل</orig>, or indirectly through a tax transparent structure.
The net accounting income or loss of the Pass-through Entity <orig>الكيان الذي يمرر الدخل</orig> shall be reduced by the amount allocated to another Constituent Entity <orig>كيان مشارك</orig>.

A Non-Profit Organisation or a Pension Fund shall be resident in a jurisdiction if it is created and managed in that jurisdiction, and an Investment Entity shall be resident in a jurisdiction if it is created and regulated in that jurisdiction. A life insurance company shall be resident in the jurisdiction in which it is located.
A Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax <orig>ضريبة الحد الأدنى المحلية التكميلية المؤهلة</orig> means: a minimum tax that is imposed in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of a jurisdiction, which meets the following conditions:
1- It determines the taxable income of Constituent Entities <orig>الكيانات المشاركة</orig> located in the jurisdiction—i.e., the domestic excess profits—in a manner consistent with the Pillar Two rules <orig>قواعد الركيزة الثانية</orig>.
2- It contributes to increasing the domestic tax liability with respect to domestic excess profits, ensuring that the tax imposed on Constituent Entities in the jurisdiction reaches the minimum tax for a fiscal period.
3- It is applied in a manner consistent with the outcomes of the Pillar Two rules and commentaries, provided that such jurisdiction does not provide any special benefits related to these rules.
The Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax on domestic excess profits may be calculated based on an acceptable financial accounting standard permitted by the authorised accounting body, or on an authorised financial accounting standard after being adjusted to prevent any material competitive distortions, instead of the financial accounting standard used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

## Article (34)
### Adjusted Covered Taxes

The Adjusted Covered Taxes <orig>الضرائب المشمولة المعدلة</orig> of a Constituent Entity for a fiscal period shall be determined to be equal to the current tax expense accrued in the financial accounting net income or loss, with respect to Covered Taxes for that period, and shall be adjusted as follows:
1- The net amount of additions to Covered Taxes for the fiscal period in accordance with the provisions of Article (35) of these Regulations, and reductions to Covered Taxes for the fiscal period in accordance with the provisions of Article (36) of these Regulations.
2- The total amount of the deferred tax adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Article (38) of these Regulations.
3- Any increase or decrease in Covered Taxes included in equity or other comprehensive income related to amounts included in the Pillar Two income or loss <orig>دخل أو خسارة الركيزة الثانية</orig> account that are subject to income tax under local tax legislation.
No amount of Covered Taxes may be calculated more than once.
If the Adjusted Covered Taxes in the State are less than zero and less than the amount of the expected Adjusted Covered Taxes in a fiscal period in which there is no net Pillar Two income in the State, the Constituent Entities located in the State shall be treated as having a current additional tax in the State in accordance with Article (47) of these Regulations, arising from the current fiscal period, equal to the difference between these two amounts.
The amount of the expected Adjusted Covered Taxes shall be calculated according to the following formula:
Expected Adjusted Covered Taxes Amount = Pillar Two Income or Loss for the State x Minimum Tax Rate.
The designated Constituent Entity may make an election for a fiscal period to replace the current additional tax amount referred to in Article (47) of these Regulations with a negative tax expense carry-forward <orig>فائض مصروفات الضريبة السالبة المرحل لفترة لاحقة</orig> to a subsequent period, in accordance with the following:
1- The negative tax expense surplus <orig>فائض مصروفات الضريبة السالبة</orig> for the fiscal period must be equal to the amount calculated under the third paragraph of this Article for that fiscal period.
2- The negative tax expense surplus carried forward to a subsequent period must be used in all subsequent calculations related to the effective tax rate in the State.
3- The total Adjusted Covered Taxes (but not below zero) must be reduced by the remaining balance of the negative tax expense surplus carried forward to a subsequent period in each subsequent fiscal period in which positive Pillar Two income and Adjusted Covered Taxes arise in the State, and the surplus of that carry-forward balance shall be reduced by the same amount.
4- In accordance with the third paragraph of this Article, the negative tax expense surplus attributable to a loss amount that was carried back to a previous period and deducted in the current fiscal period from the income of previous taxable fiscal periods for current tax purposes must be taken into account and may not be included in the carried-forward tax expense surplus.
5- The negative amount of Adjusted Covered Taxes may not be less than the amount of expected Covered Taxes under the third paragraph of this Article.
6- The carried-forward negative tax expense surplus must remain with the transferring group if the Multinational Enterprise Group disposes of one or more Constituent Entities in the State.

7- If the Multinational Enterprise Group disposes of all Constituent Entities located in the State and re-acquires or establishes Constituent Entities in the State in a subsequent Fiscal Year, the carry-forward balance of the Negative Tax Expense Surplus must be taken into account when determining the Adjusted Covered Taxes in the State starting from that Fiscal Year.
8- The Multinational Enterprise Group must maintain records of the remaining balance of the carried-forward Negative Tax Expense Surplus.

## Article (35)

1- Any amount of Covered Taxes accrued as an expense in the profit before tax in the Financial Accounts.
2- Any amount of a deferred tax asset resulting from Pillar Two Losses that has been utilized in accordance with paragraph three of Article (39) of these Regulations.

4- Any amount of credit or refund related to a Qualified Refundable Tax Credit or a Marketable Transferable Tax Credit, which was recorded as a reduction of current tax expense.

## Article (36)
### Reductions from Covered Taxes

1- The amount of current tax expense related to income excluded from the calculation of Pillar Two Income or Loss under Chapter Three of these Regulations.
2- Any amount of credit or refund related to a Non-Qualified Refundable Tax Credit or a Non-Marketable Transferable Tax Credit, which was not recorded as a reduction in current tax expense.

6- Any amount received by the issuer of a Non-Marketable Transferable Tax Credit in exchange for such credit.

8- Any gains received by the purchaser as a result of the transfer of a Non-Marketable Transferable Tax Credit, provided that the transfer occurs during the relevant Fiscal Year.

Any tax credit other than a Qualified Refundable Tax Credit or a Marketable Transferable Tax Credit shall be treated as a reduction to Covered Taxes to the extent it is used to reduce a Constituent Entity's liability for a Covered Tax for the Fiscal Year.

## Article (37)
### Allocation of Covered Taxes from one Constituent Entity to another Constituent Entity
Covered Taxes shall be allocated from one Constituent Entity to another Constituent Entity as follows:
1- With respect to Covered Taxes on income attributable to a Permanent Establishment, the following shall be observed:

5- No amount of Covered Taxes payable outside the State on distributions and deemed distributions made by a Constituent Entity located in the State to an owner Constituent Entity located outside the State may be allocated to that distributing Constituent Entity located in the State.

If there is an excess amount of Covered Taxes incurred by the owner Constituent Entity with respect to that passive income after the application of this Article, that amount may not be allocated in accordance with clauses (3) or (4) of the first paragraph of this Article.
If the Pillar Two Income of a Permanent Establishment is treated as the Pillar Two Income of the Main Entity in accordance with the provisions of the fifth and sixth paragraphs of Article (31) of these Regulations, any Covered Taxes arising in the location of the Permanent Establishment and associated with this income shall be treated as Covered Taxes of the Main Entity, up to an amount not exceeding such income multiplied by the highest tax rate on ordinary income in the State or the jurisdiction where the Main Entity is located.

# Article (38)
## Mechanism for Treating Temporary Differences
The total Deferred Tax Adjustment Amount for a Constituent Entity for the fiscal period shall be equal to the deferred tax expense accrued in its financial accounts related to the Covered Taxes for that fiscal period, if the applied tax rate is less than the Minimum Tax.
If the applied tax rate is higher than the Minimum Tax, the deferred tax expense must be adjusted to be calculated in accordance with the Minimum Tax.
The following items shall be excluded from the total Deferred Tax Adjustment Amount for a Constituent Entity for the fiscal period:
1- The amount of deferred tax expense related to items excluded from the calculation of Pillar Two Income or Loss under Chapter Three of these Regulations.
2- The amount of deferred tax expense related to disallowed and unclaimed accruals.
3- The effect of a valuation adjustment or accounting recognition adjustment of a deferred tax asset.
4- The amount of deferred tax expense resulting from a recalculation related to a change in an applicable domestic tax rate in the State.

Clause (5) shall not apply to foreign tax credits that create deferred tax assets resulting from loss carry-forwards.
The total Deferred Tax Adjustment Amount shall be adjusted according to the following items:
1- Addition of any amount resulting from any disallowed and unclaimed accruals that was paid during the fiscal period.
2- Addition of any amount resulting from any recaptured deferred tax liability identified in a previous fiscal period that was paid during the fiscal period.
3- Deduction of the amount that would have been considered a reduction in the total Deferred Tax Adjustment Amount as a result of recognizing a deferred tax asset for a tax loss for the current fiscal period, if a deferred tax asset was not recognized because the accounting recognition criteria were not met.
If the Taxpayer <orig>المكلف</orig> proves that a deferred tax asset recorded at a rate lower than the Minimum Tax can be attributed to a Pillar Two Loss, the deferred tax asset may be adjusted to an amount equivalent to the Minimum Tax in the fiscal period in which it was recorded. The total Deferred Tax Adjustment Amount shall be reduced by the amount of the increase in the deferred tax asset due to its recalculation under this Article.

If a deferred tax liability <orig>التزام ضريبي مؤجل</orig> is calculated, and it is not a "recaptured excluded accrual <orig>استحقاق مستثنى مسترد</orig>", and it has not been paid within five subsequent fiscal periods, this amount must be recaptured in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
The amount of the recaptured deferred tax liability under the preceding paragraph is considered a reduction in the Covered Taxes <orig>الضرائب المشمولة</orig> for the fifth preceding fiscal period, and accordingly, both the Effective Tax Rate <orig>معدل الضريبة الفعلي</orig> and the Top-up Tax for that period shall be recalculated, in accordance with the first paragraph of Article (47) of these Regulations.
The recaptured deferred tax liability <orig>الالتزام الضريبي المؤجل المسترد</orig> means the amount of the increase that was included in the category of deferred tax liabilities within the total deferred tax adjustment amount <orig>إجمالي مبلغ تعديل الضريبة المؤجلة</orig> in the fifth preceding fiscal period, which has not been reversed or paid by the end of the current fiscal period, unless this amount relates to a recaptured excluded accrual <orig>استحقاق مستثنى مسترد</orig>.
The recaptured excluded accrual <orig>الاستحقاق المستثنى المسترد</orig> means the amount of accrued tax expenses attributable to changes in associated deferred tax liabilities, which arise as a result of the following:
1- Cost recovery allowances on tangible assets.
2- The cost of a license or similar arrangement from the government for the use of immovable property or the exploitation of natural resources that entails significant investment in tangible assets.

## Pillar Two Loss Election
The Designated Constituent Entity <orig>الكيان المشارك المعيّن</orig> may make a Pillar Two Loss Election <orig>اختبار خسارة الركيزة الثانية</orig> in the State, instead of applying the provisions of Article (38) of these Regulations, provided that the Pillar Two Loss Election <orig>اختبار خسارة الركيزة الثانية</orig> has been filed with the first Pillar Two Information Return of the MNE Group <orig>مجموعة الكيانات متعددة الجنسيات</orig>, or with the tax return filed in the State, whichever is earlier.
If this election is exercised, a Pillar Two loss deferred tax asset <orig>أصل ضريبي مؤجل لخسارة الركيزة الثانية</orig> shall be created for each fiscal period in which there is a net Pillar Two loss <orig>خسارة صافية للركيزة الثانية</orig> in the State, in accordance with the following formula:

The Pillar Two Loss for all Constituent Entities shall also mean: the aggregate of the Pillar Two Losses of all Constituent Entities located in the State, as determined in accordance with the provisions of Chapter Three, for the Fiscal Period.

## Article (40)
### Post-Filing Adjustments and Tax Rate Changes
Any adjustment to a Constituent Entity's liability for Covered Taxes for a previous Fiscal Period, recorded in the financial accounts, shall be treated as an adjustment to the Covered Taxes in the Fiscal Period in which the adjustment is made, unless such adjustment relates to a Fiscal Period in which there was a decrease in the Covered Taxes for the Constituent Entity located in the State.

In the event of a reduction in the Covered Taxes included in the Adjusted Covered Taxes of a Constituent Entity for a previous Fiscal Period, the Effective Tax Rate and the tax for that Fiscal Period must be recalculated in accordance with the provisions of the first paragraph of Article (47) of these Regulations, taking into account the following:
1- The Adjusted Covered Taxes for the Fiscal Period shall be reduced by the amount of the reduction in Covered Taxes and the determined Pillar Two Income for the Fiscal Period.
2- Any intervening Fiscal Periods shall be adjusted, as necessary and to the extent appropriate.

The Designated Constituent Entity may make an election for a Fiscal Period to treat an immaterial reduction in Covered Taxes as an adjustment to the Covered Taxes in the Fiscal Period in which the adjustment is made. An immaterial reduction in Covered Taxes means any aggregate reduction of less than 1 million Euros (or its equivalent in Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>) in the Adjusted Covered Taxes determined in the State for a Fiscal Period.

The amount of deferred tax expense resulting from a reduction in the applicable domestic tax rate shall be treated as an adjustment to a Constituent Entity's liability for Covered Taxes claimed under this Chapter for a previous Fiscal Period, whenever such reduction results in the application of a rate lower than the Minimum Tax Rate.

The amount of deferred tax expense, upon its payment, resulting from an increase in the applicable domestic tax rate, shall be treated as an adjustment to a Constituent Entity's liability for Covered Taxes claimed under this Chapter for a previous Fiscal Period, if this amount was originally recorded at a rate lower than the Minimum Tax Rate.

The adjustment mentioned in the preceding paragraph of this Article is limited to an amount equivalent to the increase in deferred tax expenses, up to the amount of such deferred tax expenses adjusted in accordance with the Minimum Tax Rate.

If a Constituent Entity fails to pay an amount exceeding 1 million Euros (or its equivalent in Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>) of the amount it calculated as current tax expense and included in the Adjusted Covered Taxes for a Fiscal Period, within three Fiscal Periods from the last day of that period, the Effective Tax Rate and the tax for that Fiscal Period in which the unpaid amount was claimed as a Covered Tax must be recalculated, in accordance with the provisions of the first paragraph of Article (47) of these Regulations, by excluding the unpaid amount from the Adjusted Covered Taxes.

# Chapter Five
## Effective Tax Rate and Tax
## Article (41)
### Determination of the Effective Tax Rate
A Multinational Enterprise Group located in the State that has Net Pillar Two Income must calculate the Group's Effective Tax Rate for each Fiscal Period. The Effective Tax Rate for a Multinational Enterprise Group in the State is calculated according to the following formula:

<image_caption>Formula for Calculating the Effective Tax Rate</image_caption>
<image>
{
  "description": "A mathematical formula presented as text. The Effective Tax Rate equals the sum of Adjusted Covered Taxes of all Constituent Entities in the jurisdiction, divided by the Net Pillar Two Income of all Constituent Entities in the jurisdiction.",
  "type": "formula",
  "data": "Effective Tax Rate = Sum of Adjusted Covered Taxes of all Constituent Entities in the State / Net Pillar Two Income of all Constituent Entities in the State"
}
</image>

The result of the Effective Tax Rate for the Multinational Enterprise Group in the State shall be expressed as a percentage rounded to four decimal places, and each Constituent Entity not affiliated with any state or jurisdiction shall be treated as a separate Constituent Entity located in a separate jurisdiction.

The Net Pillar Two Income in the State for the Fiscal Period shall be a positive amount, if any, and is calculated according to the following formula:

<image_caption>Formula for Calculating Net Pillar Two Income</image_caption>
<image>
{
  "description": "A mathematical formula presented as text. The Net Pillar Two Income equals the Pillar Two Income of all Constituent Entities minus the Pillar Two Loss of all Constituent Entities.",
  "type": "formula",
  "data": "Net Pillar Two Income = Pillar Two Income of all Constituent Entities – Pillar Two Loss of all Constituent Entities"
}
</image>

The Pillar Two Income for all Constituent Entities means the aggregate of the Pillar Two Income of all Constituent Entities located in the State for the Fiscal Period as determined in accordance with Chapter Three of these Regulations. The Pillar Two Loss for all Constituent Entities means the aggregate of the Pillar Two Losses of all Constituent Entities located in the State for the Fiscal Period as determined in accordance with Chapter Three of these Regulations.

The Effective Tax Rate for Investment Entities and Insurance Investment Entities as set out in Article (56) of these Regulations, Minority-Owned Constituent Entities as set out in Article (49) of these Regulations, Minority-Owned Subgroups as set out in Article (49) of these Regulations, and Joint Ventures and Joint Venture Affiliates as set out in Article (53) of these Regulations, must be calculated separately for each Fiscal Period in accordance with the first paragraph of this Article.

## Article (42)
### Tax Rate and Tax Calculation
The tax rate for a Multinational Enterprise Group located in the State for each tax period shall be calculated according to the following formula:
**Tax Rate = Minimum Tax Rate of 15 percent – Effective Tax Rate**

The Effective Tax Rate in the State for each tax period shall be determined in accordance with Article (41) of these Regulations.

The Taxable Income in the State for the tax period shall be the positive amount, if any, according to the following formula:
**Taxable Income = Net Pillar Two Income – Substance-Based Income Exclusion**

The Net Pillar Two Income in the State shall be determined in accordance with paragraph three of Article (41) of these Regulations, and the Substance-Based Income Exclusion shall be determined in accordance with Article (43) of these Regulations.

The Tax in the State for the tax period shall be the positive amount, if any, according to the following formula:
**Tax = (Tax Rate × Taxable Income) + Current Additional Tax**

The terms mentioned in the preceding paragraph are defined as follows:
1- Tax Rate: The percentage difference in the State for the tax period.
2- Taxable Income: The income subject to tax in the State for the tax period.
3- Current Additional Tax: The amount determined, or treated as an additional tax for the current tax period, pursuant to paragraphs three and four of Article (34) of these Regulations, or paragraph one of Article (47) of these Regulations.

With the exception of what is stated in paragraphs two and three of Article (47) of these Regulations, the tax shall be determined for each Constituent Entity located in the State that has Pillar Two Income determined in accordance with Chapter Three of these Regulations for the tax period, which is included in the calculation of the Net Pillar Two Income in the State, according to the following formula:

**Tax Amount for a Constituent Entity = Tax Amount x (Pillar Two Income of the Constituent Entity / Total Pillar Two Income of all Constituent Entities)**

The Tax Amount refers to the amount determined in accordance with paragraph three of this Article for the tax period.

The Pillar Two Income of the Constituent Entity is the Pillar Two Income of the Constituent Entity in accordance with Chapter Three of these Regulations for the tax period.

The Total Pillar Two Income of all Constituent Entities is the sum of the Pillar Two Income of all Constituent Entities located in the State that have Pillar Two Income for the tax period included in the calculation of the Net Pillar Two Income in accordance with paragraph three of Article (41) of these Regulations.

No tax exemptions shall apply to the tax imposed in accordance with the provisions of the Law.

## Article (43)
### Substance-Based Income Exclusion
The Net Pillar Two Income determined in accordance with paragraph three of Article (41) of these Regulations shall be reduced by the amount of the Substance-Based Income Exclusion to determine the Taxable Income and calculate the tax in accordance with Article (42) of these Regulations. The designated Constituent Entity of the Multinational Enterprise Group may elect for each tax period not to apply the Substance-Based Income Exclusion by not calculating or claiming this amount when calculating the tax, in the tax return filed for the tax period.

The amount of the Substance-Based Income Exclusion shall be calculated as the sum of the eligible payroll costs and the average book value of eligible tangible assets, in accordance with the percentages mentioned in paragraph four of this Article for each Constituent Entity located in the State, with the exception of Constituent Entities that are considered Investment Entities or Insurance Investment Entities located in the State, according to the following formula:
**Substance-Based Income Exclusion = (Eligible Payroll Costs × Payroll Percentage mentioned in Paragraph Four) + (Eligible Tangible Assets × Tangible Assets Percentage mentioned in Paragraph Four)**

If the designated Constituent Entity of the Multinational Enterprise Group elects, pursuant to paragraph one of this Article, not to claim the Substance-Based Income Exclusion for a tax period, the value of the excluded income shall be zero, with the exception of the entities referred to in paragraphs five and six of Article (46) of these Regulations.

The Substance-Based Income Exclusion shall be determined as follows:

# Article (45)
## Qualified Tangible Assets

Qualified tangible assets are defined as the following:
1- Property, plant, and equipment located in the State.
2- Natural resources located in the State.
3- A lessee's right of use of tangible assets located in the State.
4- Licenses or similar arrangements issued by the government for the use of immovable property or the exploitation of natural resources in the State, provided they require significant investment in tangible assets.

The following are not considered such assets:
1- The book value of property, including land or buildings, held for the purpose of sale, lease, or investment.
2- The book value of tangible assets used to generate international shipping income or qualified ancillary international shipping income. The book value of tangible assets attributable to the Constituent Entity's income in excess of the maximum qualified ancillary international shipping income shall be included in the calculation of qualified tangible assets.

The book value of qualified tangible assets shall be the average of the book value of the tangible assets at the beginning and end of the tax period, as recorded for the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements of the Ultimate Parent Entity, after deducting net accumulated depreciation, amortization, or depletion, and adding any amount attributable to the capitalization of payroll costs.
Capitalization of payroll costs means the conversion of such costs into fixed assets to be included in the statement of financial position instead of being considered as expenses included in the income statement.

In applying the provisions of this Article, the following shall be observed:
1- The book value of tangible assets must be the value recorded in the accounts of the Constituent Entity that are used in preparing the consolidated financial statements of the MNE Group.
2- Tangible assets transferred between members of the MNE Group shall not be taken into account.
3- The book value of tangible assets must include adjustments arising from impairment losses.
When accounting standards require the reversal of the impairment mentioned in item (3) of the preceding paragraph, the resulting amount shall be included in the book value of the qualified tangible asset at the end of the reported tax period, provided that it does not exceed the book value of the qualified tangible asset that would have been calculated, after depreciation or amortization, if the impairment had not been included.

The average book value of tangible assets acquired or disposed of during the tax period must be calculated based on half the book value of those assets at the end or beginning of the tax period.
If the percentage of the period during which a qualified tangible asset is located in the State during the tax period is equal to (50%) or less of the total duration of that tax period, the amount of that tangible asset for the Constituent Entity for that tax period shall be calculated according to the following formula:

<table_caption>Formula for Proportional Book Value of Tangible Assets</table_caption>
<table>
| | | |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Proportional Book Value of Tangible Assets = | Average Book Value of the Tangible Asset | x |
| | Total number of days the tangible asset is located in the State during the tax period | |
| | --- | |
| | Total number of days in that tax period | |
</table>

If the period of presence of the qualified tangible asset in the State during the tax period exceeds a rate of (50%) of the total of that tax period, the value of the qualified tangible asset for that tax period shall be calculated at the full amount of the average book value of the qualified tangible asset.
Without prejudice to the definition of "Qualified Tangible Assets," the following provisions shall apply with respect to leased assets:
1- Qualified tangible assets held by a Constituent Entity within an MNE Group as a lessor under a lease agreement are considered qualified tangible assets of the lessor, not the lessee, if the lessee of those qualified tangible assets is another Constituent Entity in the same MNE Group and is located in the same State or jurisdiction as the lessor.
2- In the case mentioned in item (3) of the first paragraph of this Article, the value of the qualified tangible assets for the lessor for the tax period must be determined

3- Without prejudice to the preceding clause, Qualified Tangible Assets held by a Constituent Entity as a lessor under an operating lease shall be considered Qualified Tangible Assets of that lessor, provided that such assets are located in the same country or jurisdiction as the lessor. In this case, the amount of the lessor's Qualified Tangible Assets for the fiscal period related to those assets shall be determined based on the following provisions:
First: If the Qualified Tangible Asset is not leased on a short-term basis, and the lessee is another Constituent Entity in the same Multinational Enterprise Group, the excess (if any) of the average carrying value of the Qualified Tangible Asset of the lessor at the beginning and end of the fiscal period shall be calculated in comparison to the average carrying value of the asset for the lessee, which is determined at the beginning and end of that fiscal period.
Second: If the Qualified Tangible Asset is not leased on a short-term basis, and the lessee is not a Constituent Entity in the same Multinational Enterprise Group, the excess (if any) of the average carrying value of the Qualified Tangible Asset of the lessor at the beginning and end of the fiscal period shall be calculated in comparison to the average of the undiscounted amount of the remaining payments due under the lease during the fiscal period, including any renewal or extension taken into account when determining the value of the right-of-use of the Qualified Tangible Asset in accordance with the financial accounting standard used to determine the Pillar Two net income of the lessor.
Third: If the Qualified Tangible Asset is leased on a short-term basis, the carrying value of the Qualified Tangible Asset of the lessor for the fiscal period shall be recognized, and the Qualified Tangible Asset of the lessee shall be considered zero.
The average of the undiscounted amount of the remaining payments due under the lease during the fiscal period shall be calculated based on the average of the following amounts:
- The undiscounted amount of the remaining payments due under the lease at the beginning of the fiscal period.
- The undiscounted amount of the remaining payments due under the lease at the end of the fiscal period.
If a portion of a Qualified Tangible Asset held by a Constituent Entity in a Multinational Enterprise Group is designated for leasing, and the other portion of that Qualified Tangible Asset is held for the Constituent Entity's own use, the following provisions shall apply:

1- The different portions of the asset shall be treated as separate assets for the purposes of these Regulations.
2- The carrying value of the asset shall be allocated between the separate portions on a fair and reasonable basis.
An operating lease means any lease of a Qualified Tangible Asset that does not substantially transfer the obsolescence, risks, and benefits associated with the ownership of the asset to the lessee.
Qualified Tangible Assets leased for a short term means assets that are regularly leased to several different lessees during the fiscal period, and the average lease term for each lessee, including any renewals or extensions, does not exceed (30) days.

## Article (46)
Special Rules for Substance-Based Income Exclusion
The Qualified Payroll Costs and Qualified Tangible Assets of a Constituent Entity that is a permanent establishment are those included in its separate financial accounts, provided that the Qualified Employees and Qualified Tangible Assets are located in the country or jurisdiction where the permanent establishment is located.
The Qualified Payroll Costs and Qualified Tangible Assets of the permanent establishment shall not be taken into account within the Qualified Payroll Costs and Qualified Tangible Assets of the Main Entity.
If the income of a permanent establishment is fully or partially excluded in accordance with Articles (31) and (55) of these Regulations, the Qualified Payroll Costs and Qualified Tangible Assets of that permanent establishment must be excluded at the same rate from the calculation of the Substance-Based Income Exclusion for the Multinational Enterprise Group.
The following adjustments must be made to the Qualified Payroll Costs and Qualified Tangible Assets of the permanent establishment for each fiscal period:

The Substance-based Income Exclusion must be calculated for each Constituent Entity not affiliated with any state or jurisdiction separately from the calculation of the Substance-based Income Exclusion for the rest of the Constituent Entities located in the state, for each fiscal period.
The Substance-based Income Exclusion for Investment Entities, Insurance Investment Entities, Joint Ventures, Joint Venture Affiliates, Minority-Owned Constituent Entities, and Minority-Owned Subgroups must be calculated separately from the rest of the Constituent Entities located in the state, for each fiscal period.
The Eligible Payroll Costs and Eligible Tangible Assets of the Flow-through Entity that were not allocated under the first to third paragraphs of this Article shall be allocated in accordance with the following provisions:
1- If the net financial accounting income or loss of the Flow-through Entity is allocated to an owning Constituent Entity under clause (2) of the first paragraph of Article (32) of these Regulations, the Eligible Payroll Costs and Eligible Tangible Assets shall be allocated at the same rate to that owning Constituent Entity, provided that it is located in the state or jurisdiction where the eligible employees and eligible tangible assets are located.
2- If the Flow-through Entity is the Ultimate Parent Entity, the Eligible Payroll Costs and Eligible Tangible Assets located in the state or jurisdiction where the Ultimate Parent Entity is located shall be allocated to it, and those costs shall be reduced in proportion to the rate of income excluded under the first paragraph of Article (55) of these Regulations.

## Article (47)
### Amount of Current Top-up Tax
Current Top-up Tax means the amount of tax resulting from an adjustment to the Covered Taxes or the Net Pillar Two Income or Loss of a Constituent Entity as a result of a recalculation of the Effective Tax Rate for a previous fiscal period or in accordance with the second paragraph of this Article. If the recalculation of the Effective Tax Rate and tax for a previous fiscal period is required or permitted in accordance with the articles concerning the adjustment of the Effective Tax Rate, the following provisions must be adhered to:
1- The Effective Tax Rate and tax for the previous fiscal period shall be recalculated in accordance with the provisions of this Article, in addition to Articles (41), (42), and (43) of these Regulations, taking into account the adjustments to the Adjusted Covered Taxes and the Pillar Two Income or Loss, as stipulated in the articles concerning the adjustment of the Effective Tax Rate.
2- Any increase in the amount of tax resulting from the recalculation shall be treated as a Current Top-up Tax under the fourth paragraph of Article (42) of these Regulations, which arose in the current fiscal period.
If there is a Current Top-up Tax resulting from the application of the provisions of the third paragraph of Article (34) of these Regulations, the Pillar Two Income for each Constituent Entity located in the state must be equal to the result of dividing the amount of the Current Top-up Tax allocated to that entity by the Minimum Tax Rate.
The amount of the Current Top-up Tax for each Constituent Entity is allocated only to the Constituent Entities that report an Adjusted Covered Taxes amount of less than zero and less than the product of the Pillar Two Income or Loss multiplied by the Minimum Tax Rate. This amount is allocated among those entities proportionally according to the following formula:
Current Top-up Tax = (Pillar Two Income or Loss × Minimum Tax Rate) – Adjusted Covered Taxes

## Article (48)
### De Minimis Revenue and Income Exclusion
At the election of the Designated Constituent Entity, the tax on Constituent Entities located in the state shall be zero for a fiscal period if the following two conditions are met during that period:
1- The average total revenue in the state is less than 10 million Euros (or its equivalent in Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>).
2- The average total Pillar Two Income or Loss in the state is less than 1 million Euros (or its equivalent in Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>) or is a loss.
For the purposes of the preceding paragraph, the following shall apply:
1- When the Designated Constituent Entity makes the election provided for in the first paragraph of this Article, it is not required to calculate the Effective Tax Rate.
2- If the fiscal period of the Constituent Entity is not (12) months, both amounts mentioned in the first paragraph of this Article shall be adjusted proportionally using the following formula:
Each amount mentioned in clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this Article separately x Number of months in the fiscal period / 12
The election provided for in the first paragraph of this Article is an election for a single fiscal period.

The average revenue (or Pillar Two Income or Loss) in a jurisdiction refers to the average of the revenues (or Pillar Two Income or Loss) in the jurisdiction for the current Fiscal Year and the two preceding Fiscal Years.
If there are no Constituent Entities in the jurisdiction with revenues or (Pillar Two Income or Loss) during the first or second Fiscal Year preceding the current Fiscal Year, those years shall be excluded from the calculation of the average revenue and (average Pillar Two Income or Loss) for the purpose of determining whether the de minimis exclusion is applicable.
For the purposes of paragraph four of this Article, the following provisions shall apply:

2- Post-filing adjustments to the Tax Return in accordance with an adjustment to the Effective Tax Rate that result in an increase in the Pillar Two Income or revenues for a prior Fiscal Year shall be taken into account, and the satisfaction of the provisions of the first paragraph of this Article must be recalculated for the relevant Fiscal Years.
The election provided for in this Article shall not apply to a Constituent Entity that is a Stateless Constituent Entity, an Investment Entity, or an Insurance Investment Entity, and the revenues and Pillar Two Income or Loss of the Stateless Constituent Entity, the Investment Entity, and the Insurance Investment Entity shall be excluded from the calculations set forth in paragraph four of this Article.
Joint Ventures and their affiliated entities shall be treated as if they constitute a separate Multinational Enterprise (MNE) Group, and the de minimis exclusion tests shall be applied separately to those entities in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
If an MNE Group acquires entities in a merger, the revenues and Pillar Two Income or Loss of those entities for the Fiscal Years preceding the merger shall not be taken into account.

In the event of a disposal by a member of an MNE Group, the revenues and Pillar Two Income or Loss of those entities for the Fiscal Years preceding the disposal of that entity shall be taken into account.

# Article (49)

The Effective Tax Rate and the tax in the jurisdiction shall be calculated in accordance with Chapters Three to Eight of these Regulations for the members of a Minority-Owned Subgroup as if they constituted a separate MNE Group.
The Adjusted Covered Taxes and the Pillar Two Income or Loss of the members of the Minority-Owned Subgroup shall be excluded when determining the remainder of the MNE Group's Effective Tax Rate and Net Pillar Two Income in accordance with Article (41) of these Regulations.

2- When an entity that is not a member of any group (the Target Entity) merges with an entity or a group (the Acquiring Party) during the tested Fiscal Year, and neither the Target Entity nor the Acquiring Party had Consolidated Financial Statements during any of the four Fiscal Years preceding the tested Fiscal Year, the revenue threshold for the MNE Group shall be deemed to be met for that Fiscal Year if the sum of the revenues included in the financial statements or Consolidated Financial Statements of each of them for that year is equal to or exceeds 750 million Euros (or its equivalent in Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>).

3- In the event that a single Multinational Enterprise (MNE) Group subject to the scope of the law or Pillar Two demerges into two or more groups (each referred to as a "demerged group"), the revenue threshold is considered met by the demerged group as follows:
a) For the first tested fiscal year (referred to as the "demerger year") ending after the demerger occurs, the revenue threshold is considered met if the annual revenue of the demerged group in that period is equal to or exceeds 750 million euros (or its equivalent in Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>).
b) For the second to fourth fiscal years ending after the demerger, the revenue threshold is considered met if the annual revenue of the demerged group, in at least two of the fiscal years subsequent to the demerger year, is equal to or exceeds 750 million euros (or its equivalent in Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>).

In the event that an entity that is not a member of a group (referred to as the "Target Entity") merges with an entity or a group (referred to as the "Acquiring Entity") and their fiscal periods did not align before the merger, the revenue of the merged group must be calculated by combining the revenues of the relevant entities for the financial period ending on (or during) the financial period used by the group after the merger.

A merger is considered to have occurred if it results from any arrangement in which either of the following takes place:
1- All or the majority of the member entities of two or more separate groups are brought under common control such that they form entities within a merged group.
2- An entity that is not a member of any group is brought under common control with another entity or group, resulting in the formation of entities within a merged group.

Demerger means any arrangement whereby the entities of a single group are separated into two or more groups such that those entities are no longer consolidated for accounting purposes by the same Ultimate Parent Entity.

## Article (51)
Constituent Entities Joining or Leaving a Multinational Enterprise Group

The following provisions shall apply when an entity (the Target) becomes or ceases to be a Constituent Entity of a Multinational Enterprise Group as a result of the transfer of its direct or indirect ownership interests during the fiscal year (called the "acquisition year"):
1- If the Target Entity joins or leaves an MNE Group, or if the Target Entity becomes the Ultimate Parent Entity of a new group, the Target Entity shall be treated as a member of the MNE Group for the purposes of this Article if any part of its assets, liabilities, income, expenses, or cash flows are consolidated on a line-by-line basis in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Ultimate Parent Entity in the acquisition year.
2- The MNE Group in the acquisition year shall only take into account the net financial accounting income or loss and the Adjusted Covered Taxes of the Target Entity that were included in the Consolidated Financial Statements used to calculate the Pillar Two net income.
3- The Target Entity, in the acquisition year and each subsequent year, shall determine its Pillar Two Income or Loss and Adjusted Covered Taxes using the historical carrying value of its assets and liabilities.
4- For the purposes of calculating the qualifying payroll costs of the Target Entity under Article (44) of these Regulations, only those costs included in the financial statements used to calculate the Pillar Two net income shall be taken into account.
5- For the purposes of Article (45) of these Regulations, the calculation of the carrying value of the qualifying tangible assets of the Target Entity shall be adjusted proportionally to correspond with the duration of the relevant fiscal year in which the Target was a member of the MNE Group.
6- With the exception of a deferred tax asset for a Pillar Two Loss, the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities of a Constituent Entity that are transferred between MNE Groups shall be taken into account by the acquiring MNE Group in accordance with the provisions of these Regulations, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the acquiring MNE Group had controlled the Constituent Entity when those liabilities and assets arose.
7- The deferred tax liabilities of the Target Entity that were previously included in the total deferred tax adjustment amount shall be treated as reversed by the MNE Group that disposes of the Target Entity for the purposes of applying the fourth paragraph of Article (38) of these Regulations, and these tax liabilities shall be treated as arising

For the purposes of this paragraph, any subsequent reduction in the Covered Taxes under paragraph four of Article (38) of these Regulations shall be effective in the Fiscal Year in which the amount is refunded.
An exception to this is the acquisition or disposal of a Controlling Interest in a Constituent Entity, which is considered an acquisition or disposal of assets and liabilities if the following two conditions are met in the State or jurisdiction where the target Constituent Entity is located (or the State where the assets are located if that entity is tax transparent):
1- The State or jurisdiction treats the acquisition or disposal of that Controlling Interest in the same or a similar manner to an acquisition or disposal of assets and liabilities.
2- That State or jurisdiction imposes a Covered Tax on the seller calculated based on the difference between the tax basis and the consideration paid for the Controlling Interest or the fair value of the assets and liabilities.

## Article (52)
### Transfer of Assets and Liabilities
The disposal or acquisition of assets and liabilities shall be carried out in accordance with the following provisions:
1- The disposing Constituent Entity must include the gains or losses resulting from the disposal when calculating its Pillar Two Income or Loss.
2- The acquiring Constituent Entity must determine its Pillar Two Income or Loss based on the carrying value of those acquired assets and liabilities, determined in accordance with the accounting standard used for the purposes of determining the Constituent Entity's Pillar Two Income or Loss.
The provisions of the first paragraph of this Article shall not apply if the disposal or acquisition of assets and liabilities is part of a reorganization process in accordance with the Pillar Two Rules, in which case the following must be adhered to:
1- The disposing Constituent Entity must exclude any gains or losses resulting from the disposal from the calculation of the Constituent Entity's Pillar Two Income or Loss.
2- The acquiring Constituent Entity must determine its Pillar Two Income or Loss after the acquisition based on the disposing entity's carrying value of the acquired assets and liabilities at the time of disposal.
If the disposal or acquisition of assets and liabilities is part of a reorganization process in accordance with the Pillar Two Rules, and the disposing Constituent Entity has recognized a non-qualifying gain or loss, the provisions of the first and second paragraphs of this Article shall not apply, and in this case, the following must be adhered to:
1- The disposing Constituent Entity must include the gain or loss resulting from the disposal for the purposes of calculating its Pillar Two Income or Loss, up to the amount of the non-qualifying gain or loss.
2- The acquiring Constituent Entity must determine its Pillar Two Income or Loss after the acquisition based on the disposing entity's carrying value of the acquired assets and liabilities at the time of disposal, which must be adjusted in accordance with local tax legislation to take into account the non-qualifying gain or loss.
At the election of the designated Constituent Entity, a Constituent Entity in a Multinational Enterprise Group that is permitted or required to adjust the tax basis of its assets and the amount of its liabilities to fair value for tax purposes in the jurisdiction where it is located must adhere to the following:
1- The Constituent Entity must include an amount of gain or loss with respect to each of its assets and liabilities for the purpose of calculating its Pillar Two Income or Loss, which shall be equal to all of the following:
    a) The difference between the carrying value of the asset or liability for financial accounting purposes immediately before the date of the event that triggered the tax adjustment (the Triggering Event) and the fair value of that asset and liability immediately after the event.
    b) The reduction or increase by the amount of any non-qualifying gain or loss, if any, resulting from that Triggering Event.
2- The Constituent Entity must use the fair value of the asset or liability for financial accounting purposes immediately after the Triggering Event to determine its Pillar Two Income or Loss in the Fiscal Years ending after the Triggering Event occurred.
3- The Constituent Entity must include the total net amount determined in item (1) of this paragraph to determine the Constituent Entity's Pillar Two Income or Loss in accordance with one of the following two options:
    a) The total net amount of such amounts shall be included in the Fiscal Year in which the Triggering Event occurred.
    b) The total net amount of such amounts shall be spread over five consecutive Fiscal Years, starting from the Fiscal Year in which the Triggering Event occurred and in each of the four immediately subsequent Fiscal Years, unless the Constituent Entity leaves the Multinational Enterprise Group during any of those Fiscal Years, in which case the entire remaining amount must be included in the Fiscal Year in which that entity left the Multinational Enterprise Group.

Reorganization under Pillar Two means any process that includes the transfer of assets and liabilities, including a merger, demerger, liquidation, or any similar transaction in which all of the following are met:
1- The consideration, in whole or in part, is equity interests issued by the acquiring Constituent Entity or by a person related to the acquiring Constituent Entity, or in the case of a liquidation, equity interests of the target, or in the absence of any consideration, when the issuance of an equity interest has no economic significance.
2- The gain or loss of the disposing Constituent Entity on those assets is not subject to tax, in whole or in part.
3- The tax laws in the jurisdiction where the acquiring Constituent Entity is located require the calculation of taxable income after the disposal or acquisition using the tax basis of the assets of the disposing Constituent Entity, with necessary adjustments for any non-qualifying gain or loss arising from the disposal or acquisition.
A Non-Qualifying Gain or Loss means the lesser of the gain or loss of the disposing Constituent Entity arising in connection with the reorganization under Pillar Two that is subject to tax in the location of the disposing Constituent Entity, or the financial accounting gain or loss arising from the reorganization under Pillar Two.

The provisions of this Article shall apply to any permanent establishment in any of the following cases:
1- A permanent establishment through which the business of a pass-through entity is carried on, where that entity is wholly or partially the Ultimate Parent Entity of the Multinational Enterprise Group.
2- A permanent establishment through which the business of a tax transparent entity is carried on, wholly or partially, when the ownership interest of the Ultimate Parent Entity in that tax transparent entity is held directly or through a tax transparent structure.

## Article (56)
### Calculation of the Effective Tax Rate for Investment Entities
The provisions of this Article shall apply to Constituent Entities that meet the definition of an Investment Entity, except for Investment Entities that are tax transparent entities, or to which an election under Articles (57) and (58) of these Regulations applies.
The Effective Tax Rate for an Investment Entity that is a Constituent Entity located in the State must be calculated separately from the Effective Tax Rate of other Constituent Entities located in the State in accordance with Article (41) of these Regulations.
The Effective Tax Rate for each Investment Entity is calculated by dividing the amount of its Adjusted Covered Taxes by the Multinational Enterprise Group's allocable share of the Pillar Two Income of the Investment Entity in accordance with the provisions of Chapter Three of these Regulations. If there is more than one Investment Entity in the State, the Adjusted Covered Taxes and the Multinational Enterprise Group's allocable share of the Pillar Two Income or Loss of each Investment Entity must be aggregated for the purpose of calculating the Effective Tax Rate for all such Investment Entities.
The Adjusted Covered Taxes of an Investment Entity represent the sum of the following:
1- The Adjusted Covered Taxes determined for the Investment Entity under Article (34) of these Regulations and attributable to the Multinational Enterprise Group's allocable share of the Pillar Two Income of the Investment Entity.
2- The Covered Taxes allocated to that Investment Entity under Article (37) of these Regulations.
The Adjusted Covered Taxes of an Investment Entity shall not include any Covered Taxes accrued by that entity if such taxes are attributable to income that is not part of the Multinational Enterprise Group's allocable share of the Pillar Two Income of that entity.

The tax due for a Constituent Entity that is an Investment Entity is calculated by multiplying the tax rate for that Investment Entity by the positive result of the Multinational Enterprise Group's allocable share of the Pillar Two Income of that entity minus the substance-based income exclusion.
The tax rate for the Investment Entity is calculated as the difference, if any, between the Minimum Tax Rate and the Effective Tax Rate for that entity.
When more than one Investment Entity of a Multinational Enterprise Group is located in the State, the Multinational Enterprise Group's allocable share of the Pillar Two Income or Loss of each Investment Entity, in addition to the substance-based income exclusion determined for each Investment Entity, must be aggregated for the purpose of calculating a single Effective Tax Rate for all such Investment Entities.
The substance-based income exclusion for the Investment Entity is calculated in accordance with the provisions of Article (43) of these Regulations, without being bound by the exception mentioned in its second paragraph, and only the eligible tangible assets and eligible payroll costs of the Investment Entity shall be taken into account.
The provisions of this Article shall apply to Insurance Investment Entities located in the State.

## Article (57)
### Tax Transparency Election for Investment Entities
The Designated Constituent Entity may elect to treat a Constituent Entity that is an Investment Entity or an Insurance Investment Entity as a tax transparent entity, provided that the following two conditions are met:
1- The owner of the Constituent Entity is subject to income tax in the jurisdiction in which it is located under a mark-to-market or similar regime based on the annual changes in the fair market value of its ownership interest in that entity.
2- The tax rate applicable to the owner of the Constituent Entity with respect to the income mentioned in item (1) is equal to or exceeds the Minimum Tax Rate.
A Constituent Entity that indirectly holds an ownership interest in an Investment Entity or an Insurance Investment Entity through a direct ownership interest in another Investment Entity or Insurance Investment Entity is considered subject to income tax under a mark-to-market or similar regime with respect to the indirect ownership interest in the first-mentioned entity if it is subject to a mark-to-market or similar regime with respect to the direct ownership interest in the second-mentioned entity.

When conducting the test under the first paragraph of this Article, the owning Constituent Entity may apply Article (43) of these Regulations with respect to its share of the income of the Investment Entity or Insurance Investment Entity.
The duration of the test referred to in this Article shall be five fiscal periods. In the event the election is revoked, the gain or loss arising from the disposal of an asset or liability held by the Investment Entity or Insurance Investment Entity shall be determined based on the fair value of the assets or liabilities on the first day of the year of revocation.
If an election is made to treat Investment Entities or Insurance Investment Entities as transparent entities for the purposes of applying the Law, the provisions of Article (56) of these Regulations shall not apply to calculate the Effective Tax Rate for the Investment Entities or Insurance Investment Entities.
If the owning Constituent Entity is owned by a policyholder, is a controlled mutual insurance company, and holds an ownership interest in an Investment Entity, it shall be considered subject to income tax under a mark-to-market valuation system or a similar system based on the annual changes in the fair value of its ownership interest in the Investment Entity at a rate equal to or exceeding the minimum tax rate.

## Article (58)
Taxable Distribution Method Election
Upon the election of the Designated Constituent Entity, an owning Constituent Entity located in the State that is not an Investment Entity may apply the taxable distribution method with respect to its ownership interest in a Constituent Entity that is an Investment Entity, if it is reasonably expected that the owning Constituent Entity will be subject to tax on distributions from the Investment Entity at a tax rate equal to or exceeding the minimum tax rate.
The following items must be taken into account when applying the taxable distribution method:
1- Include distributions and deemed distributions from the Pillar Two Income of the Investment Entity in the Pillar Two Income of the owning Constituent Entity that received the distributions, provided it is not an Investment Entity.
2- Include the total domestic tax reduction in the Pillar Two Income and Adjusted Covered Taxes of the owning Constituent Entity that received the distributions, provided it is not an Investment Entity.
3- Treat the owning Constituent Entity's proportionate share of the Investment Entity's undistributed net Pillar Two Income for the testing year as the Pillar Two Income of the Investment Entity for the reportable fiscal period.

4- Exclude the Pillar Two Income or Loss of the Investment Entity for the fiscal period and any Adjusted Covered Taxes attributable to such income from all calculations of the Effective Tax Rate in accordance with Chapter Five and Article (56) of these Regulations, with the exception of what is stated in item (2) of this paragraph.
The undistributed net Pillar Two Income for a fiscal period is the amount of the Investment Entity's Pillar Two Income (if any) for the tested fiscal period, reduced (but not below zero) by the following:
1- Any Covered Taxes of the Investment Entity.
2- Distributions and deemed distributions to shareholders who are not Constituent Entities that are Investment Entities during the tested fiscal period.
3- Pillar Two Losses arising in the tested fiscal period.
4- Investment losses carried forward to subsequent periods.
The undistributed net Pillar Two Income for the tested fiscal period may not be reduced by the amount of distributions or deemed distributions to the extent that such distributions have been treated as a reduction of the undistributed net Pillar Two Income for a previous tested fiscal period.
The undistributed net Pillar Two Income is calculated by reducing the Pillar Two Loss to the extent that such loss reduced the undistributed net Pillar Two Income at the end of the previous fiscal period. If the Pillar Two Loss for a fiscal period is not reduced to zero before the end of the last tested period that includes this fiscal period, the remaining amount of that loss becomes an investment loss carried forward to a subsequent period and is reduced in the same manner as a Pillar Two Loss in subsequent fiscal periods.
All of this is subject to the following:
1- The tested fiscal period is the third period preceding the reportable fiscal period.
2- The testing period is the period that begins on the first day of the tested fiscal period and ends on the last day of the reportable fiscal period in which the ownership interest was held by an entity within a group.
3- A deemed distribution arises when a direct or indirect ownership interest in the Investment Entity is transferred to an entity that is not an entity within a group, and it is equal to the proportionate share of the undistributed net Pillar Two Income attributable to the ownership interest on the date of that transfer, which is determined regardless of the deemed distribution.
4- The total domestic tax reduction means the amount of Covered Taxes incurred by the Investment Entity and allowed as a credit against the tax liability of the owning Constituent Entity arising in connection with a distribution by the Investment Entity.

5- An election under this Article is an election for a period of five tax periods. If the election is revoked, the allocable share of the owning Constituent Entity of the undistributed Net Pillar Two Income of the Investment Entity for the tested period at the end of the tax period preceding the revocation period shall be treated as Pillar Two Income of the Investment Entity for the revocation period.

# Article (59)
## Election to Include Equity Investments and Qualified Flow-through Tax Benefits

The accounting gains, profits, or losses included in the Pillar Two Income or Loss shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Article (13) of these Regulations, with the exception of what is stated in clause (3) of its first paragraph.
In the event an election to include equity investments is made, all current and deferred tax expenses or benefits arising from the accounting gains, profits, or losses included in the Pillar Two Income or Loss in accordance with the first paragraph of this Article shall be included in the Adjusted Covered Taxes account, taking into account the relevant provisions of these Regulations.
The owner subject to the election to include equity investments may not apply the preceding two paragraphs to a Qualified Flow-through Tax Benefit arising from a Qualified Ownership Interest. In this case, the following provisions shall apply:
1- The amount of the Qualified Flow-through Tax Benefit may be included as a positive amount in the Adjusted Covered Taxes of the direct owner of a Qualified Ownership Interest or the indirect owner of such an interest through a chain of fiscally transparent entities that are not Constituent Entities of the Multinational Enterprise Group, to the extent that the Qualified Flow-through Tax Benefit is treated for financial accounting purposes as a reduction of tax expense.
2- The amount of the Qualified Flow-through Tax Benefit shall be equal to the amount of the tax credit or deductible tax loss that has flowed through to the owner through a Qualified Ownership Interest to the extent that the owner's investment in the Qualified Ownership Interest is reduced by any of the following:
a) The amount of the tax credit or tax loss.
b) The amount of any distributions (including return of capital) to the owner.
c) The amount of proceeds from the sale of all or part of the Qualified Ownership Interest.
3- For the purposes of clause (2) of this paragraph, the deductible tax loss shall be equal to the amount of the tax loss multiplied by the statutory tax rate applicable to the owner.
4- The application of the provisions of this paragraph shall not cause the owner's investment to become less than zero, and therefore no amount shall be treated as reducing the investment to the extent that it would reduce the investment below zero.
5- If the owner's investment is reduced to zero due to receiving tax credits or deductible tax losses through a Qualified Ownership Interest, or after receiving distributions (including return of capital) or proceeds from the sale of all or part of the Qualified Ownership Interest, the following provisions shall apply:
a) Any subsequent amount of any tax credits or deductible tax losses obtained by the owner through a Qualified Ownership Interest shall be treated as a negative amount in the owner's Adjusted Covered Taxes.
b) Any subsequent amount of any distributions (including return of capital) or proceeds from the sale of all or part of the Qualified Ownership Interest or qualified refundable tax credits obtained through the Qualified Ownership Interest shall be treated as a negative amount in the owner's Adjusted Covered Taxes to the extent that it equals the amount of any Qualified Flow-through Tax Benefit through the Qualified Ownership Interest that was treated as a positive amount in the owner's Adjusted Covered Taxes.
When using the proportional amortization method to account for the Qualified Ownership Interest for financial accounting purposes, this method shall be used to determine the amount of investment recovered in each period. Owners who do not use this method may make an irrevocable election to apply it, provided that this election is made in the first tax period in which they acquire the Qualified Ownership Interest or become subject to the Pillar Two rules.
When applying this method, any tax credit or flow-through tax loss, or any distributions (including return of capital), or proceeds from the sale of all or part of the Qualified Ownership Interest shall be treated as a reduction of the investment in proportion to the rate of expected tax benefits.
The rate of expected tax benefits is the rate of tax credits and tax losses that flowed through or were received in the tax period to the total of such items that are expected to flow through or be received with respect to the Qualified Ownership Interest over the investment period.
Tax credits or tax losses that flow through, or distributions (including return of capital), or sales proceeds received with respect to the Qualified Ownership Interest that are in excess of the decrease in investment may not be included as a positive amount in the owner's Adjusted Covered Taxes.

# Chapter Eight
## Safe Harbour and the Initial Phase of International Activity

### Article (60)
#### Safe Harbour by the Simplified Calculation Method

The tax is considered zero for the tax period when the simplified calculation method is followed for a Multinational Enterprise Group, provided that one of the following tests is met with respect to its operations in the State:
1- The routine profits test.
2- The de minimis test.
3- The effective tax rate test.

For the purposes of verifying the satisfaction of any of the tests, the Constituent Entity may use any of the following:
1- Simplified Income Calculation.
2- Simplified Revenue Calculation.
3- Simplified Tax Calculation.

When applying any of these methods, the results of these calculations must be combined with the accounts of Constituent Entities that are not classified as Non-Material Constituent Entities, as per Article (61) of these Regulations.
The Multinational Enterprise Group is considered to have met the tests referred to in the first paragraph of this Article, as follows:
1- The routine profits test, if the Pillar Two income in the State, under the Simplified Income Calculation, is equal to or less than the amount resulting from the Substance-Based Income Exclusion calculation in accordance with Article (10) of the Law.
2- The de minimis test, if the average total revenue of the taxable entities in the Multinational Enterprise Group in the State is less than 10 million euros (or its equivalent in Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>), and the average Pillar Two income of the taxable entities within the Multinational Enterprise Group in the State is less than 1 million euros (or its equivalent in Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>) in accordance with Article (13) of the Law.
3- The effective tax rate test, if the effective tax rate in the State is not less than (15%) under the Simplified Income Calculation and the Simplified Tax Calculation.

The average total revenue and average Pillar Two income are calculated for the current tax period and the two preceding periods.
The rules, implementing instructions, or circulars issued by the Tax Administration <orig>الإدارة الضريبية</orig> shall specify the controls and conditions related to the application of the provisions of this Article.

### Article (61)
#### Safe Harbour by the Simplified Calculation Method for Non-Material Constituent Entities

To determine eligibility for the safe harbour by the simplified calculation method in the State, the designated Constituent Entity may make an annual election to determine the income or loss, or the revenue and Adjusted Covered Taxes of a Non-Material Constituent Entity using the simplified calculations for the Non-Material Constituent Entity.
A Non-Material Constituent Entity is defined as an entity, including its permanent establishments, that is not consolidated on a line-by-line basis in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Ultimate Parent Entity due to size or materiality and is considered a Constituent Entity, provided that all of the following are met:
1- That these financial statements are consolidated in accordance with items (1) or (3) of the definition of Consolidated Financial Statements.
2- That the Consolidated Financial Statements are subject to an external audit.
3- If the revenue of the Constituent Entity exceeds 50 million euros (or its equivalent in Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>), its financial accounts used for Country-by-Country Reporting purposes are prepared in accordance with an Acceptable Financial Accounting Standard or an Authorised Financial Accounting Standard.

When using the simplified calculations for a Non-Material Constituent Entity, all of the following calculations related to the Non-Material Constituent Entity shall apply for the purposes of the tests related to the safe harbour by the simplified calculation method:
1- Simplified Income Calculation: The Pillar Two income of the Non-Material Constituent Entity shall be equal to the revenue determined in accordance with the relevant legislation for Country-by-Country Reporting.
2- Simplified Revenue Calculation: The revenue of the Non-Material Constituent Entity shall be equal to the revenue determined in accordance with the relevant legislation for Country-by-Country Reporting.
3- Simplified Tax Calculation: The Adjusted Covered Taxes of the Non-Material Constituent Entity shall be equal to the income tax accrued (for the current tax period) in accordance with the relevant legislation for Country-by-Country Reporting.

This legislation refers to the Country-by-Country Reporting legislation in the state of the Ultimate Parent Entity or in the state of the Substitute Parent Entity if such reports are not filed in the state of the Ultimate Parent Entity. If the state of the Ultimate Parent Entity does not have specific legislation for Country-by-Country Reporting and the Multinational Enterprise Group is not required to file such reports in a specific jurisdiction, then the relevant legislation for Country-by-Country Reporting refers to the final report of Action 13 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and the OECD guidance on "the implementation of Country-by-Country Reporting" issued on October 5, 2015.

The implementing rules and instructions or circulars issued by the Tax Administration shall determine the controls and conditions related to the application of the provisions of this Article.

## Article (62)
Transitional Country-by-Country Reporting Safe Harbour

A Multinational Enterprise Group must submit a Qualified Country-by-Country Report in accordance with Qualified Financial Statements to be eligible for the Transitional Country-by-Country Reporting Safe Harbour.

The tax due shall, at the election of the designated Constituent Entity, be zero for any fiscal period beginning on or before 31 December 2026, but not including a fiscal period ending after 30 June 2028, in any of the following cases:
1- If the following two conditions are met:
    a) The total revenue of the taxable entities in the Multinational Enterprise Group is less than 10 million Euros (or its equivalent in Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>) in the State.
    b) The total income before taxes of the taxable entities in the Multinational Enterprise Group is less than one million Euros (or its equivalent in Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>) in the State.
    The total shall be calculated for the tested fiscal period based on the Qualified Country-by-Country Reports.
2- If the simplified effective tax rate of the Multinational Enterprise Group in the State for the fiscal period beginning in 2025 or 2026, is based on the exchange of Qualified Country-by-Country Reports.
3- If the total net income before taxes of the Multinational Enterprise Group is equal to or less than the Substance-based Income Exclusion amount in accordance with the provisions of Article (10) of the Law for Constituent Entities resident in the State and in accordance with the rules of Qualified Country-by-Country Reports.

The simplified effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the simplified covered taxes by the total income before tax, based on the exchange of Qualified Country-by-Country Reports for the Multinational Enterprise Group.

If a Multinational Enterprise Group does not elect to apply Article (15) of the Law for the fiscal period during which it is subject to the Law during the transitional period, it may not elect to apply that Article in any subsequent fiscal period. If the Multinational Enterprise Group is not required to submit the Country-by-Country Report, this Article may be applied provided that the person responsible for the tax return includes data derived from the Qualified Financial Statements that would have been included in such reports.

The transitional period means all fiscal periods beginning on or before 31 December 2026, but not including any fiscal period ending after 30 June 2028.

Qualified Country-by-Country Reports means those reports that are prepared and submitted using Qualified Financial Statements.

Qualified Financial Statements means the following:
1- The accounts used to prepare the consolidated financial statements of the Ultimate Parent Entity.
2- The separate financial statements of each Constituent Entity, provided they are prepared in accordance with the financial accounting standard of the State or in accordance with an acceptable financial accounting standard or an authorized financial accounting standard, on the condition that the information contained in these statements is maintained based on this accounting standard and is reliable.
3- In the case of a Constituent Entity that is not included in the Group's consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis for reasons of size or materiality, it means the financial accounts of that Constituent Entity which are used for the preparation of the Group's Country-by-Country Reports.

Simplified covered taxes means the State's income tax expense as reported in the Qualified Financial Statements of the Multinational Entities after excluding any non-covered taxes or uncertain tax positions included in the Qualified Financial Statements of the Multinational Enterprise Group.

## Article (63)
Treatment of Certain Entities and Groups under the Transitional Country-by-Country Reporting Safe Harbour

The provisions of the Transitional Country-by-Country Reporting Safe Harbour shall apply to Joint Ventures and Joint Venture Affiliates as if they were Constituent Entities in a separate Multinational Enterprise Group, with the exception of Pillar Two income or loss and revenues that are included in the Qualified Financial Statements.

The provisions of the Transitional Country-by-Country Reporting Safe Harbour shall not apply in the jurisdiction of the Ultimate Parent Entity where that entity is a Flow-through Entity, unless all ownership interests in the Ultimate Parent Entity are held by qualified persons.

Subject to the preceding paragraph, if the Ultimate Parent Entity is a Flow-through Entity, the amount of profit (loss) before income tax (and any

A Qualified Person, in relation to an Ultimate Parent Entity that is a Flow-through Entity, means the holder of an Ownership Interest as set forth in Article (55) of these Regulations.
When an Investment Entity is resident in the State for the purposes of Country-by-Country Reporting, the following shall apply:
1- The Investment Entity must, pursuant to the paragraph below, calculate the Effective Tax Rate separately in accordance with Articles (56), (57), and (58) of these Regulations.
2- The amount of profit or loss before income tax and the income of the Investment Entity (and any related taxes) shall only be included in the State in proportion to the ownership interest of the direct owners of the Constituent Entity in the State.
The Investment Entity is not required to calculate the Effective Tax Rate separately when no election is made under Articles (57) and (58) of these Regulations and all owners of the Constituent Entity are resident in the State.
An Investment Entity includes an Insurance Investment Entity.
Net unrealized fair value loss is excluded from the profit or loss before income tax if such loss exceeds the amount of 50 million euros (or its equivalent in Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>) in a jurisdiction in a fiscal period.
Net unrealized fair value loss means the sum of all losses, reduced by any gains, arising from changes in the fair value of Ownership Interests (excluding Portfolio Shareholdings).
The following Constituent Entities and Multinational Enterprise Groups are excluded from the Transitional Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) Safe Harbour:
1- Stateless Constituent Entities.
2- Multinational Enterprise Groups with multiple parent entities if the qualified Country-by-Country Report does not include information on the joint groups.

## Article (64)
### Initial Phase of International Activity
The tax on the Taxpayer shall be zero during the initial phase of international activity, if the Constituent Entities within the Multinational Enterprise Group meet the following conditions:
1- They have members located in no more than six countries or jurisdictions, including the State.
2- The total net book value of tangible assets does not exceed 50 million euros (or its equivalent in Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>) for all entities located in all countries or jurisdictions, other than the country or jurisdiction in which the Multinational Enterprise Group has the highest value of tangible assets when the Pillar Two rules are first applied to the Multinational Enterprise Group.
3- None of the Ownership Interests in the entities located in the State are held by a Parent Entity that applies Income Inclusion Rules.
The net book value of tangible assets means the average value of tangible assets at the beginning and end of the fiscal period, taking into account accumulated depreciation, depletion, and impairment, as recorded in the financial statements prepared in accordance with approved accounting standards.
The total net book value of tangible assets in a jurisdiction is calculated based on the sum of the net book values of the tangible assets of all Constituent Entities of the Multinational Enterprise Group located in that jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraphs of this Article, tangible assets owned by Investment Entities, Insurance Investment Entities, Joint Ventures, or entities affiliated with such Joint Ventures shall not be taken into account.
Tangible assets attributable to a permanent establishment in any jurisdiction shall be allocated to the jurisdiction where that permanent establishment is located, provided that such assets are included in the separate financial statements of the permanent establishment, and they may not be considered as tangible assets of the Main Entity.
Tangible assets held by stateless entities are considered to be located outside the State, unless the Multinational Enterprise Group proves that the tangible assets are physically located within the State.
Tangible assets held by a minority-owned Constituent Entity are taken into account in full.
The provisions of this Article shall not apply to any fiscal period beginning after the expiration of five fiscal periods from the first day of the first fiscal period in which the Multinational Enterprise Group became subject to the Pillar Two rules in any jurisdiction.

## Article (65)
### Application of Safe Harbour Rules
The Tax Administration <orig>الإدارة الضريبية</orig> has the right to verify the relevant data and information if the Taxpayer has elected to apply a safe harbour in accordance with Articles (60), (61), (62), and (63) of these Regulations.

# Article (115)
## Tax Characteristics during the Transitional Period for the Application of Pillar Two
When determining the effective tax rate in the State during a transitional period and for each subsequent fiscal period, the Multinational Enterprise Group must take into account all deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities included or disclosed in the financial accounts of all Constituent Entities in the State for the transitional period. These deferred tax assets and liabilities must be taken into account at an amount equivalent to the minimum tax rate or the applicable domestic income tax rate, whichever is lower. A deferred tax asset that has been recorded at a rate lower than the minimum tax rate may also be taken into account at the minimum tax rate if the taxpayer can demonstrate that the deferred tax asset is attributable to a Pillar Two loss, subject to the following:
1- The effect of any valuation adjustment or accounting recognition adjustment with respect to a deferred tax asset shall not be taken into account.
2- Amounts related to the following laws are not considered deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities referred to in item (1):
a) Decree No. (3) of 1955 concerning Kuwaiti Income Tax and its amending laws.
b) Kuwaiti Income Tax Law in the (Designated Zone <orig>المنطقة المعينة</orig>) No. (23) of 1961.
c) Law No. (19) of 2000 concerning the support of national labor and encouraging them to work in non-governmental sectors, as amended by Law No. (32) of 2003.
d) Law No. (46) of 2006 concerning Zakat <orig>الزكاة</orig> and the contribution of public and closed shareholding companies to the state budget.
Deferred tax assets arising from items excluded from the calculation of Pillar Two income or loss under Chapter Three of the calculation process mentioned in the first paragraph of this Article must be excluded whenever these deferred tax assets arise from a transaction that occurred after November 30, 2021.
If assets are transferred between Constituent Entities after November 30, 2021, and before the start of a transitional period, the tax basis of the acquired assets (other than inventory) must be based on the carrying value of the disposing entity for those assets at the time of disposal. The deferred tax assets and liabilities that will fall within the scope of application of the Pillar Two rules shall be determined according to this basis, taking into account the following provisions:
1- A deemed deferred tax asset may be created from losses that were not recognized due to an accounting recognition adjustment or a valuation allowance, or due to failure to meet recognition criteria.
2- Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are not subject to any adjustments under items (1) to (4) of the third paragraph or the seventh paragraph of Article (38) of these Regulations, except for the adjustments referred to in the third paragraph of this Article.
3- Notwithstanding item (5) of the third paragraph of Article (38) of these Regulations, deferred tax assets realized from a deferred tax credit shall be taken into account, and their amount shall be equal to the deferred tax assets due in the financial accounts if the tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets is less than the minimum tax rate. In any other case, the value of these deferred tax assets shall be determined according to the following formula:
Deferred Tax Assets in the Financial Statements / Applicable Domestic Income Tax Rate X Minimum Tax Rate
Deferred Tax Assets in the Financial Statements means the deferred tax assets that are recorded or disclosed in the financial statements attributable to a deferred tax credit arising in the State.
Applicable Domestic Tax Rate means the tax rate applicable to the Constituent Entity in the fiscal period preceding the transitional period.
The following provisions shall apply if the tax rate applicable to the Constituent Entity is changed in a subsequent fiscal period:
1- The formula must be reapplied to the remaining balance of the tax credit in the financial accounts to determine the adjusted deferred tax asset.
2- The change in the amount of the deferred tax asset resulting from the reapplication of the formula in this Article shall not be treated as a deferred tax expense included in the adjusted covered tax account in the period in which the reapplication occurs.
3- The deferred tax expense for the period in which the reapplication occurs and subsequent periods shall be determined by reference to the amount of the reversal of the deferred tax asset after reapplying the formula in this Article.
The transitional period referred to in this Article means the transitional period for the Constituent Entity disposing of the asset, which is the first period in which its low-taxed income becomes subject to tax under the Pillar Two rules, regardless of whether other Constituent Entities in the State were subject to the Pillar Two rules.

The following provisions shall apply to determine the tax basis for Pillar Two purposes for acquired assets transferred between Constituent Entities after November 30, 2021:
1- The carrying value of the transferred assets is increased by capital expenditures or decreased by depreciation or amortization, arising after the transaction and before the beginning of the Transition Period, in accordance with the accounting standard
2- The prohibition in the financial statements used for purposes of determining Pillar Two income or loss.
3- Exclusion of any increase in depreciation or amortization attributable to the recording of assets at fair value in the financial accounting of the acquiring entity from the Pillar Two income or loss calculation.
4- If the acquiring Constituent Entity records the acquired asset at fair value in its financial accounts, it may instead use the carrying value of that asset as stated in its financial accounts for all subsequent periods if it would otherwise be entitled to take into account a deferred tax asset equal to the Minimum Tax Rate multiplied by the difference between the local tax basis of the asset and the Pillar Two carrying value of the asset determined under this Article.

The following provisions shall apply if tax is applied to the Constituent Entities in the State in a tax period that begins on or before the tax period in which a Qualified Income Inclusion Rule or a Qualified Undertaxed Profits Rule first becomes applicable to those Constituent Entities:
1- The tax period in which the Qualified Income Inclusion Rule or the Qualified Undertaxed Profits Rule came into effect for these Constituent Entities shall be the new transition tax period, and the tax attributes of these Constituent Entities shall be re-evaluated in accordance with the other provisions of this Article.
2- The excess negative deferred tax expense shall be eliminated at the beginning of the new transition tax period.
3- Paragraph seven of Article (38) of these Regulations shall not apply to any deferred tax liability that was taken into account when calculating the effective tax rate and was not recovered before the new transition tax period, but that Article shall apply to deferred tax liabilities that are taken into account in the new transition tax period and thereafter.
4- The deferred tax asset for a Pillar Two loss in accordance with Article (39) of these Regulations that arose in the period prior to the period shall be eliminated
