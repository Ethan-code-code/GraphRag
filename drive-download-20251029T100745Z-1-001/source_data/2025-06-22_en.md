### Article 14
**Determination of Tariffs**
(1) Both Contracting Parties shall permit the designated air carrier to establish tariffs for air services on a commercial market basis, including operating costs, service characteristics, user interests, reasonable profit, and any other market considerations.
(2) Both Contracting Parties may require notification or registration of tariffs imposed for flights to and from their territories with their respective aeronautical authorities by the designated air carriers of the other Contracting Party. The filing of such notification or registration may be required before the commencement of the offering of the tariff by the designated air carriers of both Contracting Parties.
(3) Without prejudice to the applicable and prevailing competition and consumer protection laws of each of the Contracting Parties, neither Contracting Party shall act unilaterally to prevent the initiation or continuation of a proposed or imposed tariff by a designated air carrier of the other Contracting Party related to the air services stipulated in this Agreement. Intervention, as described in paragraph (4) below, shall be limited to:
a. Preventing any unreasonable discriminatory prices or practices.
b. Protecting consumers from unreasonably high or restrictive prices due to the abuse of a dominant position or concerted practices among air carriers.
c. Protecting air carriers from artificially low prices.
(4) Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph (3) of this Article, the aeronautical authorities of both Contracting Parties may reject a tariff submitted by the air carriers of the other Contracting Party if the aeronautical authorities discover that the tariff proposed by the air carriers falls within the scope of paragraph (3) of this Article. In this case, the concerned aeronautical authority shall:
a. Send a notice of dissatisfaction to the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party and to the concerned air carrier at the earliest possible opportunity, and within a period not
(5) The primary objective for the provision of agreed services by the designated air carrier in accordance with this Agreement shall remain the availability of reasonable capacity that meets the air transport needs between the two countries, where the national air carrier and the country of final destination of transport operate. The exercise of the right to pick up or set down international air traffic at a point in the territory of the other Contracting Party coming from or destined for third countries at a point or points on the specified routes outlined in this Agreement shall be in accordance with the general principles for the orderly development of air transport traffic undertaken by both Parties and shall be subject to the general principle that capacity shall be proportionate to:
a. The needs of air traffic between the country of origin and the countries of ultimate destination of the air traffic;
b. The needs of transit operations carried out by the air carrier; and
c. The needs of air traffic in the region through which the air route passes, taking into account domestic and regional routes.
(6) Consultations shall be arranged between the Parties whenever either Party requests a review of the capacity offered under this Agreement to ensure the application of the principles contained in this Agreement for the operation of air routes.
(7) Each Contracting Party shall permit the designated air carrier to determine the capacity and number of flights for international air traffic it provides in accordance with commercial market needs. In accordance with this right, neither Contracting Party shall unilaterally restrict the operations of the air carriers of the other Party except in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or as may be required for customs, or for technical, operational, or environmental reasons, in accordance with the conditions mentioned in Article (15) of the Treaty.

### Article 12
**Approval of Operating Schedules and Timings**
(1) Designated air carriers shall submit to the competent aeronautical authorities of both Contracting Parties at least sixty (60) days prior to the commencement of the agreed services on the specified routes in accordance with Article (3) of this Agreement, specifying the nature of the service, the types of aircraft used, the flight schedule, and any subsequent modifications.
(2) The aeronautical authorities receiving these operating schedules shall approve them or propose any modifications thereto. In all cases, designated air carriers shall not commence their services before the schedules are approved by the concerned aeronautical authorities, and this principle shall apply to subsequent modifications.

of the validity of the aircraft's documents and its crew, and the apparent safety of the aircraft and its equipment (referred to in this Article as "ramp inspection"), provided that this does not lead to an unacceptable delay in the aircraft's departure.
4) If a ramp inspection or a series of ramp inspections results in:
a. serious concern that the aircraft or its operation does not meet the minimum standards applicable at that time in accordance with the Convention, or
b. serious concern that there is a deficiency in maintaining and adhering to the safety standards applicable at that time in accordance with the Convention, then the Contracting Party conducting the inspection shall be free, for the purpose of Article (33) of the Convention, to conclude that the requirements on the basis of which a certificate or license for that aircraft or its crew was issued, or made valid, are not in conformity with or exceed the minimum standards established under the Convention.
5) In the event that representatives of an air transport enterprise or enterprises designated by one of the Contracting Parties refuse to grant permission for a ramp inspection of their aircraft in accordance with paragraph (3) of this Article, the other Contracting Party shall be free to conclude that serious concerns exist as referred to in paragraph (4) of this Article, and may draw the conclusions mentioned in that paragraph.
6) Each Contracting Party reserves the right to immediately suspend or amend the operating authorization granted to the air transport enterprise of the other Contracting Party if it concludes that such immediate action is necessary to ensure the safety of the air transport enterprise's operations, based on the outcome of a ramp inspection or a series of ramp inspections, or the refusal to allow such an inspection, or the outcome of any consultations conducted.
7) Any action taken by one of the Contracting Parties under paragraphs (2) and (6) shall be terminated if the basis for taking such action ceases to exist.
8) Certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency, and licenses issued or validated by one Contracting Party, and remaining in force, shall be recognized as valid by the other Contracting Party for the purpose of operating the air services provided for by this Agreement, provided that the requirements under which such certificates and licenses were issued or validated are equal to or exceed the minimum standards established or to be established in conformity with the Convention. Notwithstanding this, each Contracting Party reserves the right to refuse to recognize the validity of certificates of competency and licenses for flights over its territory granted or recognized in favor of its own nationals by the other Contracting Party or by any other state.
9) If the aeronautical authorities of a Contracting Party issue an authorization to any
less than thirty (30) days from the date of sending the notification or registration of the tariff.
b. Request consultations in accordance with the procedures followed in paragraph (5) of this Article. However, if both aeronautical authorities agree in writing to reject the proposed tariff, this tariff shall be deemed approved.
5) The aeronautical authorities of each Contracting Party may request consultations with the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party regarding any tariff imposed by the air transport enterprise of the other Contracting Party for international air transport services to or from the territory of the first Contracting Party, including tariffs for which a notice of disapproval has been submitted. These consultations shall be held within a period not exceeding fifteen (15) days from the date of receipt of the request. The aeronautical authorities of both Contracting Parties shall cooperate in securing the necessary information to reach a reasonable solution to the matter in dispute.
Upon reaching an agreement on the tariff for which a notice of disapproval was sent, the aeronautical authorities of both parties shall exert their utmost efforts to put this agreement into effect, and in the event of failure to reach a mutual agreement in this regard, the tariff shall enter into force or continue to be applied.

## Article 15
### Aviation Safety
1) Each Contracting Party may at any time request consultations concerning the safety standards applied by the other Contracting Party in any area relating to aircraft crew, aircraft, or their operation. Such consultations shall begin within thirty (30) days from the date of that request.
2) If, after such consultations, one Contracting Party finds that the other Contracting Party does not effectively maintain and administer safety standards in any of those areas that are at least equivalent to the minimum standards established pursuant to the Convention, the first Contracting Party shall notify the other Contracting Party of such finding and the necessary steps to apply those minimum standards, and the other Contracting Party shall take appropriate corrective action. If the other Contracting Party fails to take such action within fifteen (15) days or any longer period as may be agreed upon, this shall constitute a basis for the application of Article (5) of this Agreement.
3) Notwithstanding the obligations mentioned in Article (16) and Article (33) of the Convention, it has been agreed that when an aircraft of an air transport enterprise or enterprises belonging to one Contracting Party operates air services to or from the territory of the other Contracting Party, while present within the territory of the other Contracting Party, the authorized representatives of that Contracting Party may subject the aircraft to an internal and external inspection to verify

# Article 16
## Aviation Security

Special provisions concerning aviation security. Both Contracting Parties shall notify the other Contracting Party of any differences between their national standards and practices relating to aviation security and the aviation security standards contained in the Convention. Either Contracting Party may request immediate consultations with the other Contracting Party concerning any such differences.

1.  The Contracting Parties affirm that their obligation, in conformity with their rights and obligations under international law, to protect the security of civil aviation from acts of unlawful interference, forms an integral part of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of their rights and obligations under international law, the Contracting Parties shall act in particular in conformity with the provisions of the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, signed at Tokyo on 14 September 1963, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, signed at The Hague on 16 December 1970, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 23 September 1971, and its Supplementary Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988, the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection, signed at Montreal on 1 March 1991, and any other international agreements relating to aviation security to which both Contracting Parties become parties.
2.  The Contracting Parties shall, upon request, provide all necessary assistance to each other to prevent acts of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft and other unlawful acts committed against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports and air navigation facilities, and any other threat to civil aviation security.
3.  The Contracting Parties shall, in their mutual relations, act in conformity with the aviation security standards, insofar as they are applied by the Contracting Parties, and recommended practices of the International Civil Aviation Organization <orig>منظمة الطيران المدني الدولي</orig> (ICAO) and its security annexes to the Convention. They shall require operators of aircraft registered in their territory, and operators who have their principal place of business or permanent residence in their territory, as well as operators of airports in their territory, to comply with
4.  Each Contracting Party shall ensure that effective measures are taken within its territory to protect aircraft and to inspect passengers and their baggage, and to conduct appropriate verification of crew, cargo (including hold baggage), and aircraft stores prior to and during boarding or loading. Such measures shall be adjusted as necessary to meet any increased threat. Each Contracting Party agrees that its designated airline(s) may be required to observe the aviation security provisions referred to in paragraph (3) and required by the other Contracting Party for entry into, departure from, or while within the territory of the other Contracting Party. A Contracting Party shall act favorably upon any request from the other Contracting Party for special reasonable security measures to meet a particular threat.
5.  When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or other unlawful acts directed against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers, crew, airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Contracting Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures aimed at terminating such incident or threat as quickly as possible, to minimize the likelihood of endangering lives.
6.  Each Contracting Party shall take such measures as it may find practicable to ensure the detention of an aircraft that has been subjected to an act of unlawful seizure or other acts of unlawful interference in its territory, unless its departure is required to protect human life. Whenever practicable, such measures shall be taken on the basis of mutual consultations.
7.  When a Contracting Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other Contracting Party has deviated from the provisions of this Article, the first Party shall have the right to request immediate consultations. Such consultations shall commence within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such a request from either Contracting Party. Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within fifteen (15) days or any period agreed upon from the commencement of consultations shall constitute grounds for withholding, revoking, suspending, or imposing conditions on the authorization of the airline(s) designated by the other Party. When an emergency so justifies or to prevent further non-compliance with the provisions of this Article, the first Party shall have the right to take interim measures in this regard at any time. Any action taken in accordance with this paragraph shall be discontinued when the other Contracting Party complies with the security provisions of this Article.

After reviewing the application and the attached documents.
Whereas the facts conclude that the applicant / Penta Furniture and Furnishings Company (W.L.L.) <orig>شركة بنتا للأثاث والمفروشات (ذ.م.م)</orig> submitted an application to the Bankruptcy Department in its capacity as (debtor) for a preventive settlement against 1- Kuwait Finance House <orig>بيت التمويل الكويتي</orig> 2- Ahli United Bank <orig>البنك الأهلي المتحد</orig> - currently Kuwait Finance House <orig>بيت التمويل الكويتي</orig> 3- Warba Bank <orig>بنك وربة</orig> 4- Al-Mulla Finance Company <orig>شركة الملا للتمويل</orig> 5- Industrial Bank <orig>البنك الصناعي</orig> and others.
Furthermore, the applicant company's operations are capable of continuing, based on a technical study by Crow Kuwait Consulting <orig>كرو كويت للاستشارات</orig>, registered with regulatory authorities, and that the applicant debtor has a plan to conduct business, has future financial flows, and that the creditors are holders of ordinary debts. The total bank debts amount to two million five hundred eighty-nine thousand and forty-one Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>, supplier debts amount to one million eight hundred forty-three thousand and ten Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>, and employee debts amount to one million four hundred thirty-four thousand three hundred sixteen Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>.

At the session on 2024/12/26, the applicant company's lawyer submitted a defense memorandum and a portfolio of documents demonstrating its ability to continue and pay creditors' debts in light of the preventive settlement plan submitted by it, especially since the applicant company had outlined in its application a summary of the proposed preventive settlement, and the agreements intended to be concluded with creditors regarding the settlement. It clarified its desire to be granted sufficient time to settle the debts outstanding against it, in order to preserve the company's entity, the value of its assets, and the interests of its shareholders, while affirming its ability to fulfill all those debts. The session began, and a decision was issued (to address the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة الإفلاس</orig> to examine the application and provide an opinion on it, clarify the possibility of preventive settlement, assess the debtor's financial situation and outstanding debts, indicate whether precautionary measures should be taken or not, and indicate whether the debtor is capable of managing his affairs and funds himself or not, and to provide us with a detailed report on this, working whenever possible to complete this according to the legal deadlines set for doing so in accordance with the Bankruptcy Law <orig>قانون الإفلاس</orig>, and to indicate the need to appoint a supervisor to examine the proposed preventive settlement, the measures taken, and whether its proposal is implemented or not, and in the former case, to state the value of the financial amount due to the supervisor, whether monthly or annually).
And whereas the latest letter from the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة إفلاس</orig> dated 2025/6/12 was received
(1 - The proposed (amended) preventive settlement plan is acceptable in principle, as stated in item Third. 2 - Appointment of a supervisor, as stated in item Fifth).
And whereas the Bankruptcy Judge decided to present the papers for today's session to act on the request to initiate preventive settlement procedures according to the presented facts.

The bankruptcy judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> shall rule on the application within ten days from the date of expiry of the period specified for responding to it, by issuing a decision to commence preventive settlement procedures. Within ten days from the date of issuance of the bankruptcy judge's <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> decision to commence, reject, or not accept the procedures, the Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> shall publish and announce the decision, notify concerned parties, disclose it on the Kuwait Stock Exchange <orig>بورصة الكويت للأوراق المالية</orig> if the debtor is listed, and instruct the debtor to disclose it on their website, in the manner deemed appropriate by the bankruptcy judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig>. The judge may approve the announcement of the decision in a daily newspaper published in a foreign country if a significant portion of the debtor's creditors, assets, or business operations are in that country, or for any other reason deemed appropriate by the bankruptcy judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig>.

# Decision

On Monday, corresponding to 2025/6/2, at the headquarters of the Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig>
With the membership of Professor / Yousef Al-Khaleji <orig>يوسف الخليجي</orig>, Bankruptcy Judge
And in the presence of Professor / Khalid Abdullah Al-Qaisi <orig>خالد عبد الله القيسي</orig>, Secretary
In Application No.: (2024/117 Declaration of Bankruptcy)
And linked to Lawsuit No. 2021/6028 Commercial 3
Registered under Automated No.: 243742900
After reviewing the documents:
Submitted by: Al-Sultan and Khalaf Trading Company <orig>شركة السلطان وخلف التجارية</orig>
Against: The First Kuwaiti Company for General Trading and Contracting <orig>الشركة الكويتية الأولى للتجارة العامة والمقاولات</orig>
Whereas the facts conclude that the applicant filed the application against the respondent for an amount of KWD 38801.212 pursuant to the judgment issued in Lawsuit No. 18911/2019 Commercial Plenary 46, which ordered the respondent to pay the applicant the amount of KWD 38801.212 and obligated it to pay expenses and a Kuwaiti Dinar amount for legal fees. The judgment was upheld in Appeal No. 2021/6028 Commercial 3, and the judgment became final and enforceable. An execution file was opened, and the respondent company was notified, but the respondent company took no action. The applicant then requested an executive attachment of the debtor's assets held by third parties, and it became clear that the respondent company was unable to pay its debts and had ceased paying the amount.
The applicant had based its application for the declaration of bankruptcy against the respondent on Articles (14, 131) of Bankruptcy Law No. 71/2020.
And since the applicant submitted its aforementioned application to the Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig>, and the esteemed Advisor, Head of the Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig>, referred it to the Bankruptcy Judge to verify the conditions and data. And since the submitted application and its attachments were reviewed, and the applicant's agent attended before the Department and submitted 3 folders of documents, the most important of which included a copy of Judgment No. 18911/2019 Commercial Plenary 46, a certificate of the operative part of Appeal Judgment No. 2021/6028 Commercial 3, a statement of execution procedures against the respondent, and a copy of an extract issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry <orig>وزارة التجارة والصناعة</orig> for the respondent company, confirming the signing of executive attachment on the company by more than one creditor, and copies of the respondent company's balance sheets for the years 2019-2020-2021-2022-2023, and a statement of all lawsuits filed against it. The respondent was represented by an agent who submitted a defense memorandum, requesting primarily the non-acceptance of the application and, alternatively, its rejection, and presented a folder of documents that were reviewed and understood. On 2024/12/12, the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة الإفلاس</orig> was contacted to provide an opinion on the submitted application. The Committee's opinion was received and concluded that, despite the company being active and having operations, the applicant was unable to obtain its funds despite the existence of judgments and was unable to execute them. It is also inferred that the company uses the partner's current account instead of the company's account for company operations, to prevent creditors from collecting their funds from the company, in addition to the company's failure to collect its funds, whether from accounts receivable or from the partner. These amounts have accumulated for a period, therefore, we recommend appointing a trustee from the list of licensed auditors at the Capital Markets Authority <orig>هيئة أسواق المال</orig> to inventory the debtor's assets and properties and take all necessary precautionary measures to ensure the debtor's ability to manage its business, provided that the trustee's mission shall be as follows:
1- Verifying accounts receivable and the reason for not collecting those amounts, and whether there is doubt about their collection.
2- Verifying the accuracy of cash reported in the balance sheet and how the company's business is managed.
3- Verifying the partner's current account, the reason for this large amount in the account, how it was formed, and the reason for its non-payment to the company, provided that the trustee submits their report within one month of their appointment or within the period deemed appropriate by the judge, and estimating the trustee's fees for 100 hours at a total amount of KWD 5000, provided that the decision to declare bankruptcy shall be reconsidered after reviewing the trustee's report. The Committee <orig>اللجنة</orig> proposes taking an urgent precautionary measure by imposing restrictions on the managing partner and on Michel Al-Absi <orig>ميشال العبسي</orig> (as a related party to the debtor company) regarding the disposal of their funds, due to the company's use of the partner's current account instead of the company's account for company operations.

Legal Basis:
And whereas Article (13) of the Commercial Law <orig>قانون التجارة</orig> stipulates that: "2- Every company shall also be considered a merchant, even if it engages in non-commercial activities."
And whereas Articles (92, 105) of the Companies Law <orig>قانون الشركات</orig> stipulate that: "A limited liability company is one in which the number of partners does not exceed fifty partners, and each of them shall not be liable for the company's obligations except to the extent of their share in the capital. The company may adopt a special name derived from its purpose or from the name of one or more partners, provided that the company's name is followed by the phrase (Limited Liability) or the term (LLC.

(L.L.C.)." The directors shall be jointly and severally liable towards the company, partners, and third parties for their violation of the provisions of the law or the company's articles of association, or for errors in management, in accordance with the rules stipulated in the chapter on joint-stock companies in this law."
And whereas Articles (1, 29, 33, 34, 132, 144) of Bankruptcy Law No. 71 of 2020 <orig>قانون الإفلاس رقم 71 لسنة 2020</orig> stipulate that: "In applying the provisions of this law, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning indicated opposite each of them... Financial deficit: The debtor's funds are insufficient to pay his debts." "The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> shall rule on the application within ten days from the date of the specified periods for responding to it, by issuing a decision to commence preventive settlement procedures, restructuring, or declaring bankruptcy, and shall specify in his decision a provisional date for the suspension of payments. If the decision to commence procedures is issued after the debtor's death or after his retirement from trade and no date for the suspension of payments is specified, the date of death or retirement from trade shall be considered the provisional date for the suspension of payments." "The Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> shall, within ten days from the date of the Bankruptcy Judge's <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> decision to commence, reject, or not accept the procedures, publish and announce the decision and notify the concerned parties." "If the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> decides to accept the commencement of bankruptcy, restructuring, or declaration of bankruptcy, and appoints in the same decision the trustee nominated by the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة الإفلاس</orig> and whose fees are estimated in accordance with the provisions of this law." "The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> shall issue his decision to commence bankruptcy declaration procedures if the following conditions are met: 1- The debtor has suspended payments. 2- There is a financial deficit in the debtor's financial position. 3- The debtor's business is not sustainable." "In all cases where the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> issues a decision to commence bankruptcy declaration procedures, the Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> shall refer the bankruptcy commencement application file to the Bankruptcy Court <orig>محكمة الإفلاس</orig> within ten days from the date of the Bankruptcy Judge's <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> decision to commence bankruptcy declaration procedures. The file shall include a report on the procedures taken regarding the application from its submission until the decision to commence procedures is issued, along with a statement of the factual and legal grounds for the decision." "Immediately upon the issuance of a decision to commence bankruptcy declaration procedures, the debtor's hand shall be restrained from disposing of and managing his funds and business, and the trustee shall undertake the management of the debtor's funds and business. All dispositions made by the debtor on the day the aforementioned decision is issued shall be considered as having occurred after its issuance, and any disposition issued contrary thereto shall be considered null and void. The trustee may file a lawsuit before the Bankruptcy Court <orig>محكمة الإفلاس</orig> to obtain a judgment of its non-enforceability, and may also submit the necessary requests to the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> to take necessary precautionary measures to protect the creditors' rights. The restraint of the debtor's hand does not prevent him from taking the necessary measures to preserve his rights in a way that does not harm the interests of the creditors."
Therefore, and in light of the foregoing, it was established from the documents that the company against which the application was filed had ceased to pay the outstanding debt owed to the applicant, despite the applicant taking enforcement procedures for the judgment issued obliging the company to pay the debt. The debt subject of the application was confirmed by the final judicial judgment issued in Appeal No. 2021/6028 Commercial 3 <orig>الاستئناف رقم 2021/6028 تجاري 3</orig>, and since the report of the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة الإفلاس</orig> was received, it is concluded that the company against which the application was filed has ceased to pay the outstanding debt owed by it since the date of the final judgment issued in favor of the applicant against it in Judgment No. 2021/6028 Commercial 3 <orig>الحكم رقم 2021/6028 تجاري 3</orig> dated 19/12/2021. Therefore, that date shall be the date of suspension of payment of the debt due from the company, despite its maturity, due to its refusal to pay that debt, which results in the acceptance of the application to commence bankruptcy declaration procedures for the company, with the appointment of Mr. Fateh Al-Azmi <orig>فاتح العازمي</orig> as trustee of the bankruptcy, as he is one of the trustees registered with the Capital Markets Authority <orig>هيئة أسواق المال</orig>.
Therefore, we have decided the following:
First: To commence bankruptcy declaration procedures for Al-Kuwaitiya Al-Oula General Trading and Contracting Company W.L.L. <orig>الشركة الكويتية الأولى للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م</orig> and to set 19/12/2021 as the provisional date for the suspension of payments, and to publish and announce the decision in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>, and to notify the concerned parties.
Second: To appoint Mr. Fateh Al-Azmi <orig>فاتح العازمي</orig> as trustee of the bankruptcy, and his fees are estimated at a total amount of five thousand Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> from the date of issuance of this decision until the closure of the bankruptcy. He shall inventory the assets and properties of the debtor company, take all necessary precautionary measures, and prepare a list of debts and a liquidation and distribution plan.

In accordance with Article (8) of the Bankruptcy Law <orig>قانون الإفلاس</orig>, decisions issued by the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> shall be executive instruments according to this law, and the Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> shall affix the enforcement formula to them, and they shall be enforceable immediately upon their issuance without notification.

In accordance with the court decision regarding the appointment of the expert dated November 23, 2023, which was for the purpose of estimating the value of only one share, we have valued the company and determined the value of one share for Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haidar Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig>.

5. Valuation

## 5.1 Valuation Approaches / Methods
There are three traditional valuation approaches: the income approach, the market approach, and the cost or asset approach. Professionals differ on the classification or definition of valuation methods within these three types. However, it is generally agreed that all valuation methods can be described as either one of these approaches or a combination of two or more of them.

### 5.1.1 Income Approach

### 5.1.5 Market Approach
- The market approach is a method of determining the value indicator of a business, an ownership interest in a business, a security, or an intangible asset using one or more methods that compare the subject with similar businesses, ownership interests, securities, or intangible assets that have been generally sold. This can be accomplished by comparing with publicly traded companies or by analyzing actual transactions of similar businesses sold. It may also include an analysis of prior transactions in the company's shares (if any).
### 5.3.1 Asset Approach
- The asset approach is based on the value of net assets less liabilities. As commonly used, this approach starts with the balance sheet book values as close as possible to the valuation date, and assets and liabilities, including unrecorded ones, are re-listed at fair value.
- Different valuation methods, including one or more of the three categories of valuation approaches, can be used in any valuation study. All applicable methods must be considered, and the most reliable method(s) for valuing the subject properties that are suitable for the valuation study should be selected.
### 5.2 Selected Methodology
- The following valuation approach that we adopted to determine the fair value of equity in the company is the Asset Approach (Net Asset Value method), given that Mahmoud Haidar & Sons General Trading & Contracting LLC <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م</orig> has no current operating elements and its value lies in its net current assets and investments.
### 5.3 Asset Approach (Net Asset Value Method)
- The fair value of equity in Mahmoud Haidar & Sons General Trading & Contracting LLC <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م</orig> was determined using the Net Asset Value method under the Asset Approach, detailed as follows:
! Analysis of unaudited management financial statements of the company's operations for 2013.
!! Comparison of book values of tangible assets with adjusted values.
!!! Classification of net asset value in a table.

- Final Equity Value as of December 31, 2023: 7.294.211

## Notes
- 1- Represents balances due from trade debtors, which have been reduced by 50% for prudence and caution, and due to significant doubt about the company's ability to collect these balances given the absence of current activity.
- 2- The value of real estate investments has been reduced by 30% due to the inability to ascertain the market value of these investments. 3. The value of financial investments available for sale has been reduced by 50% due to the inability to ascertain the market value of these investments.
## 6. Conclusion
- Based on our analysis of the information presented in this report, the underlying assumptions, and the Net Asset Value method, it was concluded that the net asset value as of December 31, 2023, and therefore the fair value of equity in Mahmoud Haidar & Sons General Trading & Contracting LLC <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م</orig> as of December 31, 2023, is KWD 8,581,424 (eight million, five hundred eighty-one thousand, four hundred twenty-four Kuwaiti Dinars). Taking into account a 15% discount factor, the value becomes KWD 7,294,211 (seven million, two hundred ninety-four thousand, two hundred eleven Kuwaiti Dinars).
- Consequently, the value of one share is estimated at KWD 72,942.11 (seventy-two thousand, nine hundred forty-two Dinars and eleven Fils Kuwaiti) – 7,294,211 ÷ 100 = KWD 72,942.11.
- After reviewing the case documents and the submissions made by Hammoud Haidar & Sons General Trading & Contracting LLC <orig>شركة حمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م</orig>, including the limited liability company amendment contract dated July 9, 2019, it appears to us that the share of Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haidar Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in Mahmoud Haidar & Sons General Trading & Contracting LLC <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م</orig> represents one share, equivalent to 1% of the company's total shares.

Fourthly: If the bidder deposits the price in the subsequent session, the auction shall be awarded to them, unless someone comes forward in that session willing to purchase with a ten percent increase, accompanied by a full deposit in the auction. In this case, the bidding shall be reopened in the same session based on this new price.
Fifthly: If the bidder fails to deposit the full price in the subsequent session and no one comes forward to bid with a ten percent increase, the bidding shall immediately be reopened at their expense based on the price at which it was awarded to them in the previous session.

With the necessity of drawing attention to the following:
(1) There is an outstanding debit balance due from Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haidar Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> amounting to KWD 1,341,000 <orig>1,341,000 دينار كويتي</orig>, as per the company's data received and included within the balance of related debtor parties, as of December 31, 2023.
(b) According to the documents reviewed, submitted by the management of Mahmoud Haidar and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig>, upon reviewing a document dated December 27, 2020, which is a limited liability company dissolution contract by virtue of an appellate court judgment, and the legal opinion issued by the Minister of Justice <orig>وزير العدل</orig> on June 14, 2022, was adopted, whereby the share of Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haidar Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> was adjusted to become 33 shares instead of one share. Accordingly, if this adjustment is adopted, the total value of these 33 shares would be KWD 2,407,089.63 (two million four hundred seven thousand eighty-nine Kuwaiti Dinars and sixty-three fils).

Members of the Board of Directors <orig>مجلس الإدارة</orig> may not participate in voting on General Assembly <orig>الجمعية العامة</orig> resolutions related to their discharge from liability for their management, or those concerning a special benefit for them, their spouses, or first-degree relatives, or a conflict existing between them and the company.

The liability stipulated in the preceding article shall be either personal liability attaching to a specific member, or joint liability among all members of the Board of Directors <orig>مجلس الإدارة</orig>. In the latter case, all members shall be jointly and severally liable to pay compensation, except for those who objected to the decision that established the liability and recorded their objection in the minutes.
