## Explanatory Memorandum for Decree-Law No. 5 of 2025 Amending Certain Provisions of Decree-Law No. 67 of 1976 Concerning Traffic
Since the issuance of Decree-Law No. 67/1976 concerning traffic approximately more than (35) years ago, with its last amendment in 2001, society has undergone many new developments and changes in various aspects of life and in diverse fields. Due to the rising rate of traffic violations and accidents, with their consequent human and material damages to private and public property, and given the increase in the number of vehicles in recent years and the expansion of the road network, this has led to a proliferation of violations, including recklessness and carelessness in driving vehicles, and numerous transgressions and wrong behaviors that violate traffic provisions and rules. This has exacerbated the traffic problem, increased its complexities, and become a troubling concern for both the General Traffic Department and individuals, as the country's traffic system has begun to suffer from certain dysfunctions resulting from the wrongful behaviors ingrained in some road users, which reflect a lack of concern for the prescribed penalties.
As the Traffic Law is one of the laws closely linked to individuals and highly relevant to their daily lives, their movements, and their fulfillment of needs, given that the use of a motor vehicle is an utmost necessity in the contemporary life of individuals that cannot be dispensed with, the increased use of motor vehicles has been accompanied by a rise in the number of violations and traffic accidents, as well as an intensification of traffic congestion. It was therefore imperative to reconsider some of the provisions of the Traffic Decree-Law to keep pace with these new developments and changes, especially with regard to stiffening penalties. The alarming increase in the number of violations and traffic accidents in the recent period has confirmed that the penalties in the Traffic Law were not sufficient or as hoped for, and did not achieve the required element of deterrence in both its specific and general forms. This is further confirmed by the fact that when Decree-Law No. 55/1999 was implemented during the period from 6-11/1999, a decrease in the rate of violations and traffic accidents was observed during its application period, compared to both the period before its application and the period after its implementation was rescinded. Under this decree, penalties were stiffened to the extent that achieves both general and specific deterrence for perpetrators of traffic violations, varying from one article to another according to the severity of the violation, and other texts were amended as required by practical necessity.
Article One has decided to amend Articles Nos. (6, 8, 14, 22, 24, 33, 33 bis, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46).
Where Article No. (6) included the issuance of a decision by the Minister of Interior regarding the rules and conditions of insurance and the cases in which insurance companies are obligated to pay an amount

The last paragraph of Article (8) of the aforementioned Decree-Law No. 67 of 1976 was amended so that the Minister of Interior <orig>وزير الداخلية</orig> may issue a decision specifying the types of plates, the conditions for selling the right of usufruct for some of them, and the value of the fees due thereon.
The first paragraph of Article (14) was amended, authorizing the Minister of Interior <orig>وزير الداخلية</orig> to issue a decision determining the number of motor vehicles to be licensed by the General Traffic Department <orig>الإدارة العامة للمرور</orig>, and the exemption for private cars was limited to citizens only.
Article (22) was amended to require obtaining a license to practice the activity of teaching the driving of motor vehicles or motorcycles, and that the locations for instruction shall be specified in the Executive Regulations.
Article (24) was amended to include the permissibility of reinstating a driving license by having the offender attend an awareness course, as specified by the Executive Regulations, or be re-tested, as deemed appropriate by the General Traffic Department <orig>الإدارة العامة للمرور</orig>.
Articles Nos. (33, 33 bis, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46) also included the stiffening of penalties prescribed in Chapter Five of the Traffic Decree-Law. This was done by raising the maximum limit for imprisonment and financial fines for traffic violations and the settlement amount for traffic violations, as well as reclassifying some traffic violations from one article to another according to the severity of the violation. It also involved adding new cases that require the application of the penalties stipulated in the said Decree-Law to their perpetrators, regulating the mechanism for home impoundment of vehicles, and giving the reports recorded by traffic enforcement or traffic monitoring devices the same legal authority as reports issued by members of the police force for crimes committed in violation of the provisions of this law.
The second article also included replacing the phrase (driving motor vehicles and motorcycles) with the phrase (driving cars) mentioned in Article (20), and replacing the phrase (driver of a motor vehicle) with the phrase (driver of a car) in Article (21). This is so that the General Traffic Department <orig>الإدارة العامة للمرور</orig> can authorize the establishment of schools for teaching the driving of all types of motor vehicles and motorcycles, whereas it was previously limited to cars only, in accordance with the practical necessity in this regard.
The third article decreed the amendment of Article (2) of the aforementioned Decree-Law No. 67 of 1976, by adding two new clauses numbered (28, 29), which included establishing a specific definition for (traffic enforcement and monitoring devices, and alternative penalties).
The fourth article also decreed the addition of a final paragraph to Articles (5, 27, 32, 45) to prohibit the issuance or renewal of licenses until the violations and fines ruled upon have been paid; to assign the process of issuing citations for parking in places where parking or waiting is not permitted, except for a specified number, to entities outside the Ministry; to prohibit the use of the road by vehicle drivers, animal keepers, and pedestrians except with a permit from the General Traffic Department <orig>الإدارة العامة للمرور</orig>; and for the Minister of Interior <orig>وزير الداخلية</orig> to issue a decision defining the authority of the police force members assigned to investigate minor traffic accidents that do not result in personal injuries, as well as the special procedures for these accidents.
The fifth article also decreed the addition of new articles numbered (36 bis, 37 bis, 39 bis, 41 bis). Article No. (36 bis) criminalized anyone who captures a photo, video, or audio clip, or publishes any of them, while committing any of the crimes stipulated in the Traffic Law. Article No. (37 bis) addressed the criminal liability of a legal person—with the exception of ministries, government agencies, and public authorities and institutions—if any of the crimes stipulated in the Traffic Law are committed, punishable by a fine. Article No. (39 bis) decreed that the court may sentence the convicted person, instead of the original penalty for the committed crime, to one or more of the alternative penalties contained therein. Article No. (41 bis) addressed the method of serving all documents to those addressed by the provisions of this law and its Executive Regulations through modern electronic notification methods.
The sixth article decreed the replacement of the word (plate) with the phrase (metal plate) and the word (plates) with the phrase (metal plates) wherever they appear in the aforementioned Decree-Law No. 67 of 1976 and its Executive Regulations.
The articles contained in the other four chapters (First, Second, Third, Fourth), with the exception of Articles Nos. (6, 8, 14, 22, 24), have remained as they are, on the basis that the subjects they contain are regulated, by amendment and addition, by the ministerial decisions issued by the Minister of Interior <orig>وزير الداخلية</orig>, which the legislator considered sufficient to address any new issues and incidents that may arise from practical application.
Based on the foregoing, and in view of the public interest and the importance and necessity of the amendments made to the Traffic Law to confront traffic violations and accidents, which requires their swift approval, as the traffic situation cannot tolerate any delay, now that the traffic problem has become a significant, if not the most important, axis of society's social, economic, and other problems, especially if we acknowledge that traffic service has become one of the main factors in making any country either attractive or repellent to foreign investments and projects.
