The judgment in absentia shall be served to the person of the convicted party, or by email, or by any other modern means of communication that can be saved and retrieved, in accordance with the terms and conditions stipulated in the aforementioned Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure.

If it is not possible to serve the judgment to the convicted party, the notice shall be delivered to their place of residence to any of their relatives or in-laws residing with them, or to any of their dependents. If none of them are found, or if the person found refuses to accept the notice, the notice shall be published in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig> and posted in prominent places in the area, and in a prominent place at their residence or workplace, and in any other place where its publication is deemed appropriate.

The president of the court that issued the judgment, or the Public Prosecutor <orig>النائب العام</orig> or their delegate, upon the request of the convicted party, may order the payment of the imposed fine in installments or its postponement for a reasonable period, provided that justification is submitted, on the condition that the full payment of the imposed fine is not delayed for more than five years.

While law in general is of paramount importance in preserving rights and regulating relationships between individuals, the Code of Criminal Procedure <orig>قانون الإجراءات الجزائية</orig> acquires a special significance, as it addresses the mechanism for applying these laws in practice, and clarifies the method of administering justice through legal tools that ensure every individual can access their rights with ease and facility.
Perhaps one of the greatest roles undertaken by the Code of Criminal Procedure and Trials <orig>قانون الإجراءات والمحاكمات الجزائية</orig> is its affirmation of state sovereignty. A state cannot be considered truly sovereign unless it has the ability to enforce its laws, execute its judgments, and set the foundations of justice in motion to reach every rights-holder at all times and in all places.
Hence, it can be said that the Code of Criminal Procedure and Trials <orig>قانون الإجراءات والمحاكمات الجزائية</orig> is the state's tool for imposing its sovereignty throughout its territory, and it is the guarantor of embodying the idea of true justice, which is not limited to the texts of the law but is reflected in the actual implementation of those texts.
However, the practical application of laws is not without its challenges. Practical experience has shown the need to keep pace with developments in communication methods, especially in light of the success of implementing "electronic notification" <orig>الإعلان الإلكتروني</orig> for serving statements of claim and appeals in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure <orig>قانون المرافعات المدنية والتجارية</orig> issued by Decree-Law No. 38 of 1980. Furthermore, there are numerous problems related to the collection of criminally imposed fines, problems that have become a significant obstacle to achieving social and financial justice.
Whereas the Amiri Order <orig>الأمر الأميري</orig> was issued on 10/5/2024, and Article (4) thereof stipulated that laws shall be issued by decree-laws, therefore, the corresponding draft decree-law was prepared, and its first article provided for the replacement of Articles (188 and 230) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Trials <orig>قانون الإجراءات والمحاكمات الجزائية</orig> issued by Law No. 17 of 1960. The amended Article (188) stipulated that a judgment in absentia shall be served to the person of the convicted party, or by electronic mail, or by any other modern means of communication that can be saved and retrieved, in accordance with the rules set out in the aforementioned Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure <orig>قانون المرافعات المدنية والتجارية</orig>.
The amended Article (230) included provisions to address the problem revealed by practical experience regarding the extensive accumulation of criminally imposed fines, such that these amounts have become a heavy burden that is difficult to collect in many cases. To make matters worse, the failure to collect these fines from the convicted has resulted in a series of serious legal problems, most notably the statute of limitations on criminal cases and the lapsing of penalties due to the passage of time. These issues ultimately lead to the state losing its legitimate right to collect these amounts, even though these fines are a right with a general privilege that the Public Treasury <orig>الخزانة العامة</orig> must collect for the benefit of the nation.
For this reason, the amended text was introduced to define more effective procedures for collecting criminal fines. It stipulates that if the convicted person does not pay the imposed fine, it shall be collected by means of compulsory execution against their assets. It also permits the Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> to collect it through monthly deductions not exceeding one-quarter of the convicted person's salary, wage, employment support, or pension. This text also grants the authority to the president of the court that issued the judgment, or to the Public Prosecutor <orig>النائب العام</orig> or their delegate, to order the payment of the adjudicated amount in installments or to postpone it for a reasonable period upon the request of the convicted person, provided they submit justification for it, on the condition that the full payment of the adjudicated amount is not delayed beyond five years.
This ensures that such amounts do not accumulate, on the one hand, and prevents the loss of the state's rights, on the other.
