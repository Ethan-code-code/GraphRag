Kuwait Today / Al-Kuwait Al-Youm <orig>الكويت اليوم</orig> Supplement 2 to Issue 1736, Seventy-First Year 3

Furthermore, the Amiri Decree <orig>الأمر الأميري</orig> referred to in Article (3) stipulated that His Highness the Amir <orig>سمو الأمير</orig> and the Council of Ministers <orig>مجلس الوزراء</orig> shall assume the competencies vested in the National Assembly <orig>مجلس الأمة</orig>.

Given that Law No. 12 of 1963 <orig>القانون رقم 12 لسنة 1963</orig> concerning the Internal Regulations of the National Assembly <orig>اللائحة الداخلية لمجلس الأمة</orig> is the law concerned with regulating the work of the Assembly and its committees, the provisions of its membership and related privileges, the rights and duties of its members, the organization of its presidency, its bureau, and all its other provisions, and among these texts was the text of Article (39) <orig>المادة (39)</orig>, which stipulates that the National Assembly Bureau <orig>مكتب مجلس الأمة</orig> shall be responsible for the following matters: (c) To establish the rules and provisions regulating the administrative and financial affairs of the Assembly and its employees, and otherwise, the laws and regulations in force in this regard shall apply. It shall exercise the powers granted to the Council of Ministers <orig>مجلس الوزراء</orig>, the Civil Service Council <orig>مجلس الخدمة المدنية</orig>, the Civil Service Commission <orig>ديوان الخدمة المدنية</orig>, and the Minister of Finance <orig>وزير المالية</orig> in this regard), and the text of Article (176) <orig>المادة (176)</orig> and what it stipulated, that the General Secretariat of the Assembly <orig>الأمانة العامة للمجلس</orig> shall be organized by a decision of the Speaker <orig>الرئيس</orig> after the approval of the Assembly Bureau <orig>مكتب المجلس</orig>, and this decision shall include the detailed provisions related to administrative, financial, personnel, and stores affairs.

And the text of Article (178) <orig>المادة (178)</orig>, which stipulated that in the event of the dissolution of the National Assembly <orig>مجلس الأمة</orig>, the General Secretariat <orig>الأمانة العامة</orig> shall be attached to the Presidency of the Council of Ministers <orig>رئاسة مجلس الوزراء</orig>.
Consequently, the Speaker of the National Assembly <orig>رئيس مجلس الأمة</orig> issued Decision No. (26) of 2009 <orig>القرار رقم (26) لسنة 2009</orig> approving the Administrative Functional Regulations for Civil Employees <orig>لائحة النظام الإداري الوظيفي للموظفين المدنيين</orig> at the General Secretariat of the National Assembly <orig>الأمانة العامة لمجلس الأمة</orig>, and Decision No. (46) of 2014 <orig>القرار رقم (46) لسنة 2014</orig> with the Policies Guide and Rules of Procedures and Personnel Affairs Systems <orig>دليل السياسات وقواعد إجراءات ونظم شئون الموظفين</orig> regulating the salary and benefits system for these employees. These included provisions that differed from the general principles of employment in the state established by virtue of Decree-Law No. 15 of 1979 <orig>المرسوم بقانون رقم 15 لسنة 1979</orig> concerning Civil Service <orig>الخدمة المدنية</orig>, and the Decree issued in 1979 <orig>المرسوم الصادر سنة 1979</orig> concerning the Civil Service System <orig>نظام الخدمة المدنية</orig> and their amendments, which apply to all state employees, except for those specifically exempted by a special legal text.

And since the National Assembly <orig>مجلس الأمة</orig> was dissolved, and its related constitutional provisions were suspended for four years by virtue of the aforementioned Amiri Decree <orig>الأمر الأميري</orig>, it consequently followed – by necessity – that the provisions of the aforementioned Law No. 12 of 1963 <orig>القانون رقم 12 لسنة 1963</orig> became suspended and inapplicable. The civil employees of the General Secretariat of the Assembly <orig>الأمانة العامة للمجلس</orig> had been attached to the Presidency of the Council of Ministers <orig>رئاسة مجلس الوزراء</orig> in accordance with the provisions of Article (178) <orig>المادة (178)</orig> of the aforementioned law, and they no longer perform the duties that

Kuwait Today / Al-Kuwait Al-Youm <orig>الكويت اليوم</orig> Supplement 2 to Issue 1736, Seventy-First Year

Article One of this draft stipulated the suspension of all provisions stipulated in Law No. 12 of 1963, referred to, until the expiration of the four-year period stipulated in Article (2) of the aforementioned Amiri Decree, or until the date of the election of the first National Assembly <orig>مجلس الأمة</orig> after the date of implementation of the provisions of this Decree-Law, whichever is earlier. This is a logical period consistent with the return of parliamentary life in the state, which necessitates the existence of the internal regulations of the National Assembly <orig>مجلس الأمة</orig>, to enable the Assembly to carry out its duties.
With emphasis that the ruling by which the employees of the General Secretariat of the Assembly <orig>الأمانة العامة للمجلس</orig> were attached to the Prime Minister's Office <orig>رئاسة مجلس الوزراء</orig> upon the dissolution of the National Assembly <orig>مجلس الأمة</orig> is still in effect, so that there is no room for interpretation or explanation regarding the legal status of these employees in light of the suspension of all provisions of the aforementioned Law No. 12 of 1963.
In accordance with the established principle that there is no ijtihad <orig>اجتهاد</orig> (independent reasoning) in the presence of a clear text, Article One of the present draft explicitly states that the suspension of the provisions of Law No. 12 of 1963, referred to, is not limited to suspending the operation of its articles only, but rather extends to all decisions and rulings issued based on this law, especially the decisions and rulings regulating the affairs of the employees of the General Secretariat of the National Assembly <orig>الأمانة العامة لمجلس الأمة</orig>.
For the same aforementioned reason, Article Two of the presented draft Decree-Law explicitly stipulated the applicability of the provisions of Decree-Law No. 15 of 1979, referred to, and the provisions of the Civil Service System <orig>نظام الخدمة المدنية</orig> to the employees of the General Secretariat of the National Assembly <orig>الأمانة العامة لمجلس الأمة</orig>. It is self-evident that these provisions include all decisions issued by the Civil Service Council <orig>مجلس الخدمة</orig> or Bureau <orig>ديوان الخدمة</orig> related to public employment affairs, provided that these provisions shall be effective from the date of implementation of this Decree-Law until the re-implementation of the provisions of Law No. 12 of 1963, referred to, considering that the Civil Service Law <orig>قانون الخدمة المدنية</orig> and its system represent the general law applicable to all state employees, except for those specifically exempted by a special provision.
Article Three of the draft stipulated the repeal of any provision that contradicts its provisions.
Article Four thereof obligated the Prime Minister <orig>رئيس الوزراء</orig> and the Ministers <orig>الوزراء</orig> to implement it, and specified its effective date as the date of its publication in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>.
