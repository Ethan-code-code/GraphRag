# Explanatory Memorandum <orig>المذكرة الإيضاحية</orig>
## Regarding Decree-Law No. 69 of 2025
Amending Certain Provisions of Law No. 2 of 2016
Concerning the Establishment of the Public Anti-Corruption Authority <orig>الهيئة العامة لمكافحة الفساد</orig>
and Provisions Related to Financial Disclosure <orig>الكشف عن الذمة المالية</orig>

In the context of enhancing the system of transparency and integrity and supporting national efforts aimed at combating corruption, this Decree-Law <orig>مرسوم بقانون</orig> comes as an amendment to certain provisions of Law No. (2) of 2016 concerning the establishment of the Public Anti-Corruption Authority <orig>الهيئة العامة لمكافحة الفساد</orig> and provisions related to financial disclosure <orig>الكشف عن الذمة المالية</orig>, to address gaps arising from the practical application of its provisions and to align with new developments.
The Decree has included new categories under the umbrella of the Law's provisions, thereby enhancing the comprehensiveness of anti-corruption efforts, in addition to including crimes stipulated in Decree-Law No. (24) of 1979 concerning Cooperative Societies <orig>الجمعيات التعاونية</orig> among corruption crimes.
This Decree has deemed it appropriate to establish a new formation for the Council, naming it the Authority's Board of Directors <orig>مجلس إدارة الهيئة</orig>, consisting of five members, including the Chairman, his Deputy, and three full-time members.
This Decree has entrusted the Authority's Board of Directors <orig>مجلس إدارة الهيئة</orig> with the jurisdiction to dismiss complaints submitted to the Authority if they are found not to meet the submission conditions, by a reasoned decision <orig>قرار مسبب</orig> with the majority of members, while affirming the Authority's right to appeal decisions by the investigating authority <orig>جهة التحقيق</orig> to dismiss complaints.
It was also deemed appropriate to stipulate that the identity and data of the informant <orig>المبلغ</orig> shall not be disclosed except to the competent investigating authorities <orig>جهات التحقيق المختصة</orig> upon their request, or with the written approval of the Authority, along with the introduction of a provision allowing the Authority to accept financial disclosure statements <orig>إقرارات الذمة المالية</orig> submitted in the form of an electronic document.
To provide the necessary guarantees for the Authority's employees, the Decree has granted the Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> exclusive jurisdiction to investigate, dispose of, and prosecute incidents committed by the Authority's employees during or due to the performance of their duties, while ensuring that the Authority's Board of Directors <orig>مجلس إدارة الهيئة</orig> is notified of investigation dates and procedures taken.
This Decree has introduced the possibility of accepting reconciliation <orig>الصلح</orig> in crimes of delay in submitting financial disclosure statements <orig>إقرارات الذمة المالية</orig> if the person subject to the provisions of this Law initiates the submission of the statement within the specified period and pays the determined amount, which achieves flexibility without prejudice to the principles of justice.

# Explanatory Memorandum
## Regarding Law-Decree No. 70 of 2025
## Repealing the Text of Articles (159 and 182)
### Of the Penal Code <orig>قانون الجزاء</orig> issued by Law No. 16 of 1960

Stemming from the constitutional principles guaranteed by the Constitution of the State of Kuwait <orig>دولة الكويت</orig> in protecting motherhood and childhood, caring for the youth and protecting them from exploitation and neglect, and in implementation of the international obligations adopted by the State through its ratification of conventions and agreements concerned with child rights, it has become necessary to repeal the text of Article (159) of the Penal Code <orig>قانون الجزاء</orig> issued by Law No. (16) of 1960, regarding the mitigating legal excuse provided by this text for a mother who kills her newborn immediately after birth to avoid shame.

The necessity of this repeal is based on several justifications, including the conflict of the aforementioned Article (159) with the principles established by the Constitution of the State of Kuwait <orig>دولة الكويت</orig>, especially what Article (9) thereof stipulates: (The family is the foundation of society; its pillars are religion, morality, and love of the homeland. The law preserves its entity, strengthens its bonds, and protects motherhood and childhood under its umbrella), and what Article (10) of the Constitution <orig>الدستور</orig> stipulates: (The State is committed to caring for the youth and protecting them from exploitation, and safeguarding them from moral, physical, and spiritual neglect), given that the right to life is the basis of all other rights that are linked to it in existence and non-existence. This principle is affirmed by Islamic Sharia <orig>الشريعة الإسلامية</orig> in the words of Allah Almighty in verses (8, 9) of Surat At-Takwir <orig>سورة التكوير</orig> (And when the girl buried alive is asked, for what sin she was killed), and His saying, Exalted be He, in verse (31) of Surat Al-Isra <orig>سورة الإسراء</orig> (And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for you and for them).

Furthermore, other considerations related to the repeal of the aforementioned Article (159) of the Penal Code <orig>قانون الجزاء</orig> are in line with the international obligations of the State of Kuwait <orig>دولة الكويت</orig> under the Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989, which the State ratified by Law No. (104) of 1991, especially what this Convention stipulated in its Article Six: (States Parties recognize that every child has the inherent right to life) and States Parties shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child, and what was stated in the Arab Charter on the Rights of the Child of 1983, which the State of Kuwait <orig>دولة الكويت</orig> approved by Law No. (36) of 1993, and which emphasized the necessity of providing the highest degree of legal protection for children from all forms of violence and neglect.

For all these reasons, it has become clear that the continued application of Article (159) of the aforementioned Penal Code <orig>قانون الجزاء</orig>, by allowing an unjustified exception in mitigating punishment for crimes targeting a child's life, contradicts the constitutional principles and international obligations as previously explained.

And stemming from the same established constitutional principles guaranteed by the Constitution of the State of Kuwait <orig>دولة الكويت</orig> in protecting rights and freedoms, ensuring justice and equality among members of society, and in implementation of the international obligations adopted by the State through its ratification of conventions concerned with combating violence against women, it has also become imperative and necessary to repeal the text of Article (182) of the aforementioned Penal Code <orig>قانون الجزاء</orig>, which stipulated the exemption of a kidnapper from punishment if he marries the person he kidnapped, due to the explicit contradiction of this article's ruling with the provisions of the Constitution <orig>الدستور</orig>, established legal principles, and relevant international conventions.

This contradiction is represented by the conflict of Article (182) of the aforementioned Penal Code <orig>قانون الجزاء</orig> with Article (29) of the Constitution <orig>الدستور</orig>, which stipulates that (People are equal in human dignity, and they are equal before the law in public rights and duties, with no discrimination among them in this regard due to sex, origin, language, or religion). The aforementioned Article (182) allows an unjustified advantage for the perpetrator to escape punishment merely by marrying the victim, which creates legal discrimination that harms women's rights and undermines the principle of equality before the law.

Furthermore, this constitutes a blatant violation of the victim's rights and perpetuates a culture of impunity, which necessitates its repeal to ensure the alignment of national legislation with constitutional values and criminal justice, as it has become clear that its continued application provides an unjustified legal cover for perpetrators.

And since the Amiri Order <orig>الأمر الأميري</orig> was issued on 2024/5/10, and Article (4) thereof stipulated that laws shall be issued by law-decrees, a draft of the similar law-decree was prepared, and its first article stipulated the repeal of the text of Articles (159 and 182) of the aforementioned Penal Code <orig>قانون الجزاء</orig>. And it was issued as:
# Decree No. 89 of 2025
## Regarding the Withdrawal of Kuwaiti Nationality
## From Certain Persons

- Having reviewed the Constitution <orig>الدستور</orig>,
- And the Amiri Order <orig>الأمر الأميري</orig> issued on 2 Dhu al-Qi'dah 1445 AH corresponding to May 10, 2024 AD,

Filed by: Yaqoub Yusuf Ali Al-Marbani <orig>يعقوب يوسف علي المربني</orig>
The Court <orig>المحكمة</orig>
After reviewing the documents and deliberation.
Whereas the appellant challenged the unconstitutionality of the second paragraph of Article (14) of Law No. (1) of 1993 concerning the Protection of Public Funds <orig>حماية الأموال العامة</orig>, which punishes a public employee <orig>الموظف العام</orig> if, through their error, they cause serious harm to the funds or interests of the entity they work for or are connected with by virtue of their position, and if the grave error committed by them resulted in damage to the country's financial, commercial, or economic conditions, or to any national interest thereof, the appellant argued that this text violated the principle of legality of crime and punishment <orig>شرعية الجريمة والعقوبة</orig> as its wording was undefined and unclear, capable of bearing more than one meaning, in a way that could lead to multiple interpretations regarding the concept and limits of grave error <orig>الخطأ الجسيم</orig> and serious harm <orig>الضرر الجسيم</orig>, which constitutes a violation of personal liberty <orig>الحرية الشخصية</orig> guaranteed by Article (30) of the Constitution <orig>الدستور</orig>.
The appellant also challenged the unconstitutionality of the first paragraph of Article (20) of the same law, which did not permit the application of Article (81) in any case to any of the crimes mentioned in this law unless the perpetrator promptly returned the full funds subject of the crime before the closing of pleadings <orig>إقفال باب المرافعة</orig> in cases where restitution is mandatory, as it thereby established an unjustified distinction between perpetrators of intentional crimes against public funds <orig>الاعتداء على المال العام</orig> who are obliged to make restitution, in which case Article (81) may be applied to them, and those not obliged to make restitution, in violation of the principles of justice, equality, and equal opportunities <orig>العدالة والمساواة وتكافؤ الفرص</orig>, in addition to its breach of the fair and equitable trial <orig>المحاكمة العادلة المنصفة</orig> standards stipulated in Articles (7), (8), (29), (34), and (163) of the Constitution <orig>الدستور</orig>.
The appellant also challenged Article (21 bis) <orig>21 مكرراً</orig> of the same law, which stipulated that criminal proceedings <orig>الدعوى الجزائية</orig> for crimes stipulated in this law shall not lapse by prescription <orig>بمضي المدة</orig>, thereby depriving perpetrators of unintentional grave error <orig>الخطأ الجسيم غير العمدي</orig> crimes from the prescription of their criminal actions, despite the fact that intentional and unintentional crimes in all laws are subject to the periods of prescription stipulated by law, which violates the principle of equality <orig>مبدأ المساواة</orig> stipulated in Article (29) of the Constitution <orig>الدستور</orig>.

the entity for which he works, and he was convicted by a final judgment that is not subject to review or appeal. Therefore, a ruling on the unconstitutionality of that text – assuming the validity of the appellant's claim regarding preventing the judge from exercising his discretionary power to decide not to pronounce punishment – will not have an effect on the judgment issued convicting him, as long as it does not extend to removing the text of criminalization itself. Consequently, it will not result in his retrial for the same act again, as he remains responsible for the error committed and for compensating the damages incurred by his employer because of it. Thus, he does not have a direct personal interest in the appeal. And since the appellant, in the similar appeal, re-directed the same appeal to the text of the two aforementioned articles, the basis for accepting his appeal is lacking. Nor does it benefit him to subsequently add an appeal against Article (21 bis) <orig>21 مكرراً</orig> of the Law, which stipulated that criminal proceedings for crimes stipulated in this law shall not lapse by prescription. It is inconceivable to consider the prescription of criminal proceedings after a final judgment of conviction has been issued and executed. Furthermore, this prescription has no relation to the compensation claim filed by his employer to demand compensation for the damages he caused, which relies on the provisions of tort liability. Therefore, he also does not have a direct personal interest in appealing this article. Nor does the argument that he still suffers from the moral and ethical effects of the judgment issued convicting him change this, as a legally recognized interest cannot be merely a theoretical interest, aiming solely to annul the challenged texts in an abstract manner. Rather, the appellant must derive a direct benefit from requesting their annulment, which makes it appropriate to rule on the inadmissibility of the appeal and the confiscation of the guarantee.
Therefore,
the Court – in the consultation chamber – decided to dismiss the appeal and confiscate the guarantee.

The appellant added that he had a direct personal interest in filing the present appeal due to the issuance of a final criminal judgment convicting him under the aforementioned challenged texts, despite their unconstitutionality. This resulted in damages, represented by a claim for compensation from the administrative entity for which he worked, under lawsuit No. (8027) of 2019, Civil General Government/14, and its appeal No. (3913) of 2023, Commercial Civil Government/10, and the issuance of a judgment obliging him to pay substantial financial amounts as compensation. The cassation appeal against that judgment, No. (1268) of 2024 Civil, has not yet been decided to date. And that a ruling on the unconstitutionality of those articles would render them null and void, thus making them unsuitable as a basis for claiming compensation. Furthermore, the judgment issued convicting him resulted in his deprivation from working in his financial specialization, which affects his career future.
Given that, and as stipulated in Article (4 bis) <orig>الرابعة مكرراً</orig> – added by Law No. (109) of 2014 to the Law Establishing the Constitutional Court <orig>قانون إنشاء المحكمة الدستورية</orig> No. (14) of 1973 – although the legislator permitted any natural or legal person to file an appeal by direct claim before this Court – against any law, decree-law, or regulation – the legislator explicitly required in the text of this article that the appellant must have a direct personal interest, without which the appeal is inadmissible. This means that the legislative text alleged to violate the Constitution must have caused harm to the appellant as a result of its application to him, or that the probability of harm to him is high, such that a ruling on its unconstitutionality would remove this harm and achieve a benefit for him. Furthermore, the legislator required that the appeal be serious as an indispensable condition for its acceptance, and this Court may investigate this matter. If it finds that the appeal is not serious, it shall decide – in the consultation chamber – to dismiss it.
In light of the foregoing, and as this Court previously concluded in its decision issued by the consultation chamber on 10/7/2024 in direct appeal No. (5) of 2024 – filed by the appellant himself – that the phrases in the second paragraph of the challenged Article (14) were "clear and explicit, without ambiguity or obscurity, as they openly state the forms of error required therein, the damages that may befall the employer because of it, and the penalty prescribed for these acts. It is not a defect in the text to leave it to the judge to assess the gravity of this error or the damages resulting from it in light of the material facts presented before him. Thus, the text does not violate the aforementioned articles of the Constitution." The Court also affirmed in the same decision that the appeal against the first paragraph of Article (20) of the Law does not achieve a significant interest for the appellant that would distinguish his right to file an appeal against it, as this appeal relates to the prescribed penalty and the judge's authority to decide not to pronounce punishment. It has been established that the accusation attributed to the appellant has been settled due to his error in causing serious damage to the funds of

Whereas the appellant company challenged the unconstitutionality of Clause (First / B) of Executive Rule No. (28) of the Executive Rules and Instructions for Kuwaiti Income Tax Decree No. (3) of 1955, as amended by Law No. (2) of 2008, issued by Administrative Decision No. (875) of 2013 by the Assistant Undersecretary for Financial and Tax Affairs, insofar as it stipulated that the costs and expenses of subcontractor works should not exceed the revenues of these works for them to be deductible from taxable income, in violation of Article (3) of the Income Tax Decree, which mandated the deduction of all expenses and costs incurred to generate taxable income, and Article (3) of the Executive Regulations of Law No. (2) of 2008, which specified the conditions for allowable expenses and costs deductible from taxable income, limiting these conditions to being necessary for generating income from the activity, being genuine and supported by documents, and relating to the taxable period. Thus, the challenged text has added a condition not found in the law or its executive regulations, which renders it unconstitutional for violating the principle of separation of powers, the principle that no tax may be established or amended except by law, and the principle that laws and regulations may not be applied retroactively, as stipulated in Articles (50), (51), (72), (73), (134), and (179) of the Constitution, in addition to the illegitimacy of that text for violating an effective and applicable legal provision. The appellant had a direct personal interest in filing the present appeal, as tax was assessed against it for the financial years ending on 31/12/2013 and 31/12/2014, and the deduction of costs and expenses for subcontractor works from taxable income was disallowed in accordance with the aforementioned executive rule. Consequently, it challenged the tax assessment, and the dispute between it and the Ministry of Finance <orig>وزارة المالية</orig> in this regard is still pending before the judiciary, which prompted it to file this appeal.

It was established, in accordance with Article (Fourth bis) – added by virtue of Law No. (109) of 2014 to the Law Establishing the Constitutional Court <orig>الحكمة الدستورية</orig> No. (14) of 1973 – that while the legislator permitted any natural or legal person to file a direct claim before this Court <orig>الحكمة</orig> challenging any law, decree-law, or regulation, the legislator explicitly required in the text of this article that the appeal must be serious as an indispensable condition for its acceptance. This Court <orig>الحكمة</orig> may investigate this matter, and this Court <orig>الحكمة</orig> may investigate this matter. If it finds that the appeal is not serious or falls outside its jurisdiction, it shall decide – in chambers – to dismiss it.

Given this, and since the grounds for the appeal primarily concerned the violation by the challenged text, from the Executive Rules and Instructions for the Kuwaiti Income Tax Decree, of the law under which it was issued, due to the law not including the condition it stipulated for deducting expenses and costs related to subcontractor works from taxable income, and given that the aforementioned text did not involve the establishment of a new tax or its amendment, and the jurisprudence of this Court <orig>الحكمة</orig> has established that the subject of judicial review it exercises regarding the constitutionality of regulations is based on a conflict between a provision therein and a provision in the Constitution. If the challenged decision suffers from a defect of illegality, then this defect is considered related to its legality, sufficient alone to request its annulment before the Administrative Circuit <orig>الدائرة الإدارية</orig>, which has become solely competent to annul administrative decisions that violate laws since the issuance of Decree-Law No. (20) of 1981 establishing a circuit within the Court of First Instance <orig>الحكمة الكلية</orig> to hear administrative disputes, as amended by Law No. (61) of 1982, as the Administrative Circuit <orig>الدائرة الإدارية</orig> must, before applying any regulatory provision, ascertain its legality and conformity with the law. Consequently, the challenged text falls outside the scope of judicial review exercised by the Constitutional Court <orig>الحكمة الدستورية</orig>, and it is appropriate to rule on the inadmissibility of the appeal and the forfeiture of the bond.

Therefore,
The Court <orig>الحكمة</orig> – in chambers – decided to dismiss the appeal and forfeit the bond.

The following decision was issued:
Regarding the Direct Appeal / Consultation Chamber
Registered in the Court's register under number (3) for the year 2025
Filed by: Inverted House Coffee Shop Company <orig>شركة كوفي شوب البيت المقلوب لتقديم المشروبات</orig> for Beverage Services
The Court
After reviewing the documents and deliberation,
Whereas the appellant company challenged the unconstitutionality of the decision of the Minister of Commerce and Industry <orig>وزير التجارة والصناعة</orig> No. (227) for the year 2024 regarding the amendment of Decision No. (27) for the year 2015 issuing the executive regulations of Law No. (39) for the year 2014 concerning consumer protection, specifically regarding the addition of Article (40 bis) to the regulations, which authorized the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry <orig>وكيل وزارة التجارة والصناعة</orig> to issue a decision granting exclusive and comprehensive licenses to companies or establishments approved by the competent official authorities, to undertake the organization of major national events and celebrations, the appellant arguing that this article contained provisions not included in Law No. (39) for the year 2014 concerning consumer protection, and were not necessary for its implementation, and involved an amendment to its provisions, as the law regulated how to obtain a license to conduct temporary discounts or special offers on prices of goods displayed to the public without differentiation among those addressed by its provisions, while the challenged ministerial decision allowed the granting of exclusive licenses to specific companies to the exclusion of others, in violation of the provisions of this law, and also violated Articles (7) and (8) of the Constitution, as it restricted the organization and conduct of special offers and discounts to the company exclusively licensed for that purpose, and compelled other companies to submit to it and join it in this matter, which contradicts the principles of equality and equal opportunities. The appellant had a direct personal interest in filing the present appeal, as, based on the challenged decision, the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry <orig>وكيل وزارة التجارة والصناعة</orig> issued a decision granting one of the companies licensed by the Ministry an exclusive license to organize the Kuwait Shopping Festivals <orig>مهرجانات الكويت للتسوق</orig> in 2025, thereby depriving the appellant of the opportunity to apply for a license for that purpose, which prompted it to file the present appeal.
It is established, in accordance with Article (4 bis) – added by virtue of Law No. (109) for the year 2014 to the Law establishing the Constitutional Court <orig>المحكمة الدستورية</orig> No. (14) for the year 1973 – that while the legislator permitted any natural or legal person to file a direct appeal before this Court against any law, decree-law, or regulation, the legislator explicitly stipulated in this article that seriousness in the appeal is an indispensable condition for its acceptance, and this Court may investigate this matter, and if it finds that the appeal is not serious or falls outside its jurisdiction, it shall decide – in the Consultation Chamber – its inadmissibility.
Given this, and as the jurisprudence of this Court has settled that equality before the law is achieved by the fulfillment of the conditions of generality and abstraction in the legal rule, and it is clear that the challenged decision permitted the granting of exclusive and comprehensive licenses to companies or establishments approved by the competent official authorities, to undertake the organization of major national events and celebrations, by virtue of a general, abstract rule applicable to all those addressed by its provisions without any differentiation or discrimination among them, therefore, the claim of its violation of the principle of equality and equal opportunities is unfounded, and the matter in this regard reverts to how companies are selected for such licensing, which is a matter related to the application of the text and thus falls outside the scope of this Court's oversight.
As for the argument regarding the challenged decision's violation of the law under which it was issued, the jurisprudence of this Court has settled that the judicial oversight it exercises concerning the constitutionality of regulations is predicated on a conflict between a provision therein and a provision in the Constitution, so if the challenged decision suffers from a defect of violating the law, then this defect is considered related to its legality, sufficient alone to request its annulment before the Administrative Circuit <orig>الدائرة الإدارية</orig>, which has become solely competent to annul administrative decisions that violate laws since the issuance of Decree-Law No. (20) for the year 1981 establishing a circuit within the General Court <orig>المحكمة الكلية</orig> to hear administrative disputes, amended by Law No. (61) for the year 1982, as the Administrative Circuit must, before applying any regulatory text, verify its legality and conformity with the law, and therefore the challenged decision falls outside the scope of judicial oversight exercised by the Constitutional Court <orig>المحكمة الدستورية</orig>, and it is appropriate to rule the appeal inadmissible and confiscate the bond.
Therefore,
The Court – in the Consultation Chamber – decided to dismiss the appeal as inadmissible and confiscate the bond.

Regarding the Direct Appeal / Consultation Chamber
Registered in the Court's register under number (16) for the year 2024
Filed by: Jamal Essa Ibrahim Al-Hafez <orig>جمال عيسى إبراهيم الحافظ</orig>
The Court

After reviewing the documents and deliberation.

Whereas the appellant challenged the unconstitutionality of Article (3) of Law No. (88) of 1995 regarding the trial of ministers, concerning its provision for the formation of an investigation committee composed of three Kuwaiti <orig>كويتيين</orig> counselors from the Court of Appeal <orig>محكمة الاستئناف</orig>, specialized in examining submitted complaints and possessing all legally prescribed powers of investigation authorities. This challenge was based on its alleged violation of Article (167) of the Constitution, which stipulates that the Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> shall undertake public prosecution on behalf of society, with the only exception being what it permits security authorities to undertake public prosecution in misdemeanors according to the procedures specified by law. The appellant had a direct personal interest in filing the present appeal, as a decision was issued on 5/8/2024 by the aforementioned committee to seize all his cash, movable assets, and real estate, and to prevent him from disposing of them, in connection with the investigation in Case No. (2) for the year 2024, concerning the investigation of ministers, despite him not being investigated or charged with any offense therein, which prompted him to file the present appeal.

It was established, in accordance with Article (Fourth bis) – added by virtue of Law No. (109) of 2014 to the Law establishing the Constitutional Court <orig>المحكمة الدستورية</orig> No. (14) of 1973 – that while the legislator permitted any natural or legal person to file a direct appeal before this Court against any law, decree-law, or regulation, the legislator explicitly stipulated in this article that seriousness in the appeal is an indispensable condition for its acceptance. This Court has the discretion to investigate this matter, and if it finds the appeal to be not serious, it shall decide – in the Consultation Chamber <orig>غرفة المشورة</orig> – its inadmissibility.

Given the foregoing, and since Article (132) of the Constitution entrusted the legislator with issuing a special law defining crimes committed by ministers in the performance of their duties, and outlining the procedures for their accusation, trial, and the manner of such trial, in response to this constitutional directive, the legislator issued Law No. (88) of 1995 regarding the trial of ministers. This law specified the body competent to try ministers as a special court composed of five Kuwaiti <orig>كويتيين</orig> counselors from the Court of Appeal <orig>محكمة الاستئناف</orig>. Due to the specificity and importance of the crimes falling under the jurisdiction of that court, the legislator deemed it appropriate – pursuant to the text of Article (3) of the aforementioned and challenged law – that a special investigation committee, composed of three Kuwaiti <orig>كويتيين</orig> counselors from the Court of Appeal <orig>محكمة الاستئناف</orig>, should undertake the preliminary investigation and investigation work in these cases. This is in compliance with Article (132) of the aforementioned Constitution, which authorized the legislator to determine the accusation procedures for these crimes. Thus, this committee was assigned the task of examining submitted complaints in this regard and taking any necessary action required by such examination, possessing all legally prescribed powers of investigation authorities. The law did not overlook the role of the Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> in public prosecution, as it mandated the presence of a Public Prosecution member, whose rank is not less than that of a Chief Prosecutor <orig>رئيس نيابة</orig>, at investigation sessions to express any requests they deem appropriate. It also stipulated that the Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> is responsible for undertaking the prosecution before the Court. Therefore, the claim of unconstitutionality of the challenged text for violating Article (167) of the Constitution is unfounded, which means that the seriousness required for the present appeal is not met, and thus it is appropriate to rule its inadmissibility and confiscate the bail.

Therefore,
The Court – in the Consultation Chamber <orig>غرفة المشورة</orig> – decided to dismiss the appeal and confiscate the bail.

The statutory reserve may only be used to cover the company's losses or to ensure the distribution of dividends to shareholders at a rate not exceeding five percent of the paid-up capital in years when the company's profits do not allow for the distribution of this percentage, due to the absence of a statutory reserve that permits the distribution of this percentage of profits. What has been deducted from the statutory reserve must be returned to it when the profits of subsequent years allow, unless this reserve exceeds half of the issued capital.
2 - A percentage of 1% (one percent) of the company's annual net profits shall be deducted for the company. The approval was given to increase the capital from an amount of 57,512,772.600 D.
