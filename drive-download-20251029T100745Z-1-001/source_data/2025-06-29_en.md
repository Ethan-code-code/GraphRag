In the name of His Highness the Amir of the State of Kuwait
Sheikh Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah <orig>الشيخ مشعل الأحمد الجابر الصباح</orig>
Court of First Instance <orig>المحكمة الكلية</orig>
Decision

On Sunday, 15/6/2025, at the headquarters of the Bankruptcy Administration <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig>, with the membership of Mr. Zaid Abdul Hadi Al-Attar <orig>زيد عبد الهادي العطار</orig>, Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig>, and in the presence of Mr. Khaled Abdullah Al-Qubaisi <orig>خالد عبد الله القبيسي</orig>, Secretary <orig>أمين السر</orig>.
In Application No. (1/2024 Restructuring)
Registered under Automated No. 241562490
Submitted by: Al-Mishtereka Group for Contracting Company <orig>شركة المجموعة المشتركة للمقاولات</orig>
Against: Al-Ma'rouf and Al-Narjis Joint Company for General Trading <orig>شركة المعروف والنرجس المشتركة للتجارة العامة</orig>
Having reviewed the documents and the memorandum of Nour Faisal Jassem Al-Narjis <orig>نور فيصل جاسم النرجس</orig> requesting the appointment of an inspector, and in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Law <orig>قانون الإفلاس</orig> and its executive regulations:
The facts are established in what was encompassed by the decision of the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> in the present application, issued on 18/11/2024, to which we refer to avoid repetition.
Whereas, as stipulated in Article 1 of the Bankruptcy Law <orig>قانون الإفلاس</orig>, "The Inspector <orig>المفتش</orig>: A person licensed to perform the duties of a trustee <orig>الأمين</orig> who conducts inspections of all the debtor's business and records, or inspects specific operations or facts and submits a report thereon."
And as stipulated in Article (51) of the same law, "The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> may, upon a reasoned request submitted by the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة الإفلاس</orig>, a regulatory body, a creditor, the observer <orig>المراقب</orig>, the trustee <orig>الأمين</orig>, or on his own initiative, appoint an inspector <orig>مفتش</orig> from among the persons authorized to perform the duties of a trustee <orig>الأمين</orig> or from others, and assign him to inspect all of the debtor's business, assets, or dispositions, or to inspect a specific fact or facts, provided that the request to appoint the inspector <orig>مفتش</orig> pertains to a debtor for whose debts an application to initiate proceedings has been filed in accordance with the provisions of this law. In the event a trustee <orig>أمين</orig> or observer <orig>مراقب</orig> is appointed, the trustee <orig>الأمين</orig> or observer <orig>المراقب</orig>, as the case may be, shall undertake the inspection task. The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> shall rule on the application within ten days from the date of its submission to the Bankruptcy Administration <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig>. The decision appointing the inspector <orig>مفتش</orig> shall specify the task assigned to him, his competencies, powers, and fees if he is not one of those appointed as a trustee <orig>أمين</orig> or observer <orig>مراقب</orig>. In this case, the provisions of Articles (34, 35) of this law shall apply to him. The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> may authorize the inspector <orig>مفتش</orig> to seek assistance from whomever he deems necessary to accomplish the assigned task. Article (49) of this law shall apply to the inspector's <orig>مفتش</orig> fees. The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> may require the creditor who requested the inspection to pay these fees in advance, to be recovered from the debtor's assets if the inspector <orig>مفتش</orig> concludes that the facts on which the creditor based the inspection request are valid."
And as stipulated in Article (52) thereof, "In order to carry out the assigned task, the inspector <orig>المفتش</orig> may request to hear the testimony of any person without an oath. He may also request any information or documents from the debtor, a creditor, units subject to the Central Bank <orig>البنك المركزي</orig>, persons licensed by the Authority <orig>الهيئة</orig>, regulatory bodies, or any other governmental or non-governmental entity. If the aforementioned person or entity deems that such testimony, information, or documents are not relevant to the task assigned to the inspector <orig>المفتش</orig>, they must submit a request to the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> within ten days from the date of being notified of the inspector's <orig>المفتش</orig> request, seeking exemption from all or part of what the inspector <orig>المفتش</orig> has requested. The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> shall issue his decision on the request within ten days from the date of its submission, and his decision shall be final." And as stipulated in Article (53), "The inspector <orig>المفتش</orig> must complete the task he is assigned to carry out and submit a report to the Bankruptcy Administration <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> detailing how it was executed and the results he reached, within the deadlines specified in the assignment decision. The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> may extend the execution of the task upon the inspector's <orig>المفتش</orig> request."
Guided by the foregoing, and since the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> has the authority to appoint an inspector <orig>مفتش</orig> and assign him to inspect the assets of the debtor for whose debts an application to initiate bankruptcy declaration proceedings has been filed; and as Nour Faisal Jassem Al-Narjis <orig>نور فيصل جاسم النرجس</orig>, in her capacity as one of the partners in the company against which the application was filed, has requested the appointment of an inspector <orig>مفتش</orig>, other than the appointed trustee <orig>الأمين</orig>, to review the company's books and documents to ascertain the validity of the debt subject to the restructuring request.

Therefore, we have decided:
First: To appoint the auditor, Dr. Abdulaziz Nasser Nafea Muqbil Al-Rashidi <orig>عبد العزيز ناصر نافع مقبل الرشيدي</orig>, to review the papers and documents submitted in the present application, as well as to review the papers, books, and documents of the respondent company / Al-Ma'rouf and Al-Narjis Joint General Trading Company <orig>شركة المعروف والنرجس المشتركة للتجارة العامة</orig> and its books, and to conduct an inspection of its assets, to clarify the financial position of the company, the amount of profits and losses, and who is responsible for them, if any, the fair value of the company, and whether the data provided in the restructuring application reflects the true financial position of the company. This shall be for a period of three months from the date of publication and announcement of the decision in the Official Gazette. We have authorized him, in the course of performing his mission, to seek the assistance of whomever he deems necessary to accomplish the task assigned to him, to hear the testimony of any person whose statements he deems necessary to hear without oath, and to request any information or documents from the debtor, any of the creditors, units subject to the Central Bank, persons licensed by the Authority, or other governmental or non-governmental entities, or to visit them, if necessary, and to take all necessary measures for that purpose. He is tasked with submitting a report at the end of the mission's term on how the task was executed and the results he reached. The appointed inspector's fees are set at the amount of (2000 K.D.) two thousand Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>, to be paid to him in advance by the applicant for the inspection, in addition to the necessary expenses incurred by the inspector, which will be disbursed to him without procedures. The applicant shall recover the fees and expenses from the funds of the respondent company if the inspector concludes that the facts on which she based her inspection request are correct.

Second: The Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> shall publish this decision in the Official Gazette, register it in the Commercial Register, and legally notify the concerned parties of this decision.

Decision

On Thursday, 19/6/2025, at the headquarters of the Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig>
With the membership of Mr. / Yousef Al-Julaibi <orig>يوسف الجليبي</orig>, Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig>
And in the presence of Mr. / Khalid Al-Qaisi <orig>خالد القيسي</orig>, Clerk of the Court <orig>أمين السر</orig>

In Application No.: 2024/117
Associated with Case No. 2021/6028 Commercial 3
And registered under automated No.: 243742900
After reviewing the papers:
Submitted by: Al-Sultan and Khalaf Trading Company <orig>شركة السلطان وخلف التجارية</orig>
Against: The First Kuwaiti Company for General Trading and Contracting <orig>الشركة الكويتية الأولى للتجارة العامة والمقاولات</orig>
The facts of the case are that the applicant is a creditor to the respondent for the amount of 38,801.212 K.D. pursuant to the judgment issued in Case No. 2019/18911 Plenary Commercial 46, which ordered the respondent to pay the applicant the amount of 38,801.212 K.D. and obligated it to pay the expenses and the sum of one hundred Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> for attorney's fees. The judgment was upheld in Appeal No. 2021/6028 Commercial 3, and the judgment has become final and enforceable. An execution file was opened and the respondent company was notified, but the respondent company took no action. The applicant then requested an executory attachment of the debtor's assets held by third parties, and it became clear that the respondent company is unable to pay its debts and has ceased payment of the amount.
The applicant based her request for the declaration of bankruptcy of the respondent on Articles (14, 131) of the Bankruptcy Law No. 71/2020. As the applicant submitted her aforementioned request to the Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig>, the Counselor, Head of the Bankruptcy Department, referred it to the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> to verify the conditions and data. The submitted application and its attachments were reviewed, and the applicant's representative appeared before the Department and submitted 3 document portfolios, the most important of which included a copy of Judgment No. 2019/18911 Plenary Commercial 46, a certificate of the operative part of the judgment in Appeal No. 2021/6028 Commercial 3, a statement of the execution procedures against the respondent, and a copy of an extract issued by the Ministry of Commerce <orig>وزارة التجارة</orig>.

In accordance with Article (8) of the Bankruptcy Law, decisions issued by the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> shall be considered writs of execution in accordance with this law. The Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> shall affix the executory formula to them, and they shall be enforceable immediately upon issuance and without notification.

and Industry for the company against which the application was filed is established, as is the imposition of an executory attachment on the company by more than one creditor, copies of the balance sheets of the company against which the application was filed for the years 2019-2020-2021-2022-2023, and a statement of all cases filed against it. The respondent company was represented by its legal counsel, who submitted a defense memorandum requesting, in its conclusion, primarily the inadmissibility of the application and, alternatively, its rejection. A portfolio of documents was submitted, which was reviewed and noted. On 12/12/2024, the Bankruptcy Committee was addressed to provide its opinion on the submitted application. The Committee's opinion was received, and it concluded that although the company is operational and has business activities, the applicant was unable to obtain its funds despite the existence of judgments and was unable to enforce them. It is also inferred that the company uses the partner's current account instead of the company's account for its business activities, so that creditors cannot collect their funds from the company, in addition to the company's failure to collect its funds, whether from accounts receivable or from the partner, and these amounts have been accumulating for a period. Therefore, we recommend the appointment of a trustee from the list of licensed auditors at the Capital Markets Authority to inventory the debtor's assets and properties and take all necessary precautionary measures to ensure the debtor's ability to manage its business, with the trustee's mission being as follows: 1- Verifying the accounts receivable and the reason for not collecting these amounts, and whether there is any doubt about their collection. 2- Verifying the accuracy of the cash reported in the balance sheet and how the company's business is managed. 3- Verifying the partner's current account, the reason for the existence of this large amount in the account, how it was formed, and the reason for its non-payment to the company, provided that he submits his report within one month of his appointment or the period deemed appropriate by the judge. The trustee's fees were estimated at 100 hours for a total amount of KWD 5,000, with the decision to declare bankruptcy to be reconsidered after reviewing the trustee's report. - The Committee proposes taking an urgent precautionary measure by placing restrictions on the managing partner, Wadih Michel Al-Absi <orig>وديع ميشال العبسي</orig> (as a related party to the debtor company), in disposing of his funds, due to the company's use of the partner's current account instead of the company's account for its business activities. Whereas, on 2/6/2025, the bankruptcy judge issued a decision to initiate bankruptcy declaration procedures for Al-Kuwaitiya Al-Oula for General Trading and Contracting W.L.L. <orig>الشركة الكويتية الأولى للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م</orig>, setting 19/12/2021 as a provisional date for the cessation of payments, and to publish and announce the decision in the Official Gazette, and to notify the concerned parties thereof.

Second: The appointment of Mr. Faleh Al-Azmi <orig>فالح العازمي</orig> as the trustee of the bankruptcy, with his fees estimated at a total amount of five thousand Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> from the date of this decision until the closure of the bankruptcy. He is to inventory the debtor company's assets and properties, take all necessary precautionary measures, and prepare a list of debts and a plan for liquidation and distribution. Whereas, after the issuance of the decision, the respondent company was represented by its legal counsel, accompanied by the company's director, Wadih Michel Al-Absi <orig>وديع ميشال العبسي</orig>, who presented proof of full payment of the claimed amount. He submitted a photocopy of check number 661696 drawn on Gulf Bank dated 16/6/2025, and a photocopy of the check deposit receipt in execution file No. 19399885 Al-Asimah dated 18/6/2025 for the full claimed amount, and undertook to pay the trustee's fees. Whereas, as Article (1) of the Bankruptcy Law defines bankruptcy as (procedures aimed at the collective settlement of a debtor's debts towards their creditors through the liquidation of their assets and business and the distribution of the liquidation proceeds to their creditors, all in accordance with the provisions of the law.) And Article 9 of the Law stipulates (The Bankruptcy Department shall have jurisdiction over the following: 1- Receiving and registering applications submitted in accordance with the provisions of this law....). And Article 131 of the same law stipulates (Without prejudice to the provisions of this law regarding the application to initiate proceedings, as well as the cases specified in the chapter on preventive settlement and the chapter on restructuring, in which the bankruptcy judge may issue a decision to initiate bankruptcy declaration proceedings, the bankruptcy judge shall issue his decision to initiate bankruptcy declaration proceedings if the following conditions are met:

1- The debtor has ceased payments.
2- There is a deficit in the debtor's financial position.
3- The debtor's business is not viable for continuation).

Based on the foregoing, since it is established that the basis of the applicant's claim is that he is a creditor to the company sought to be declared bankrupt for the claimed amount by virtue of a judgment issued by the Commercial Circuit, and the Bankruptcy Department had addressed the Bankruptcy Committee, which concluded that the debtor company is operational and has business activities, and the legal counsel of the respondent company and its director appeared and confirmed the payment of the debt amount subject to the bankruptcy application filed against it, presenting the check deposit receipt in execution file No. 19399885 Al-Asimah dated 18/6/2025, the matter: which renders the debtor not to have ceased payments, thereby failing to meet one of the legally prescribed conditions, and the application is worthy of rejection. As for the costs of the application, the applicant shall be liable for them in accordance with Article Seven of Ministerial Resolution No. 81 of 2021 issuing the Executive Regulations of Law No. 71 of 2020 issuing the Bankruptcy Law.

**For these reasons**

We have decided:
1- To reverse our previous decision issued on 2/6/2025 to initiate bankruptcy declaration procedures for Al-Kuwaitiya Al-Oula for General Trading and Contracting W.L.L. <orig>الشركة الكويتية الأولى للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م</orig>.
2- To reject the application, with notification of this decision to the applicant and the respondent, and to record it in the electronic register at the Bankruptcy Department, while obligating the applicant to bear the costs.

Clerk of the Court
Bankruptcy Judge

In accordance with Article (8) of the Bankruptcy Law, decisions issued by the bankruptcy judge shall be considered executory instruments under this law. The Bankruptcy Department shall affix the executory formula to them, and they shall be enforceable immediately upon issuance and without notification.

And whereas Article (44) of the Bankruptcy Law stipulates that "The Trustee <orig>الأمين</orig> must deposit any amount received within the proceedings into a special account at the bank designated by the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> within a period not exceeding ten days from the date of its receipt, and must submit to the Bankruptcy Administration a statement of account for those amounts within ten days from the date of deposit or within any other period specified by the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig>. If the Trustee <orig>الأمين</orig> delays depositing any amounts received for the purpose of deposit without an acceptable justification, the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> may compel him to pay a late penalty at a rate of 7% annually on the value of the amounts not deposited, and this penalty shall be deposited into the account referred to in the preceding paragraph and shall become part of the general guarantee for creditors. The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> may, in the case referred to in the preceding paragraph, replace the Trustee <orig>الأمين</orig>."

In light of the foregoing, and as the Trustee <orig>الأمين</orig> has requested permission to open an account in the name of the bankruptcy estate <orig>التفليسة</orig> to collect the financial amounts received for its benefit, and since the Bankruptcy Law has obligated the Trustee <orig>الأمين</orig> to deposit any amount received within the proceedings into a special account at the bank designated by the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> within a period not exceeding ten days from its receipt, it has been decided to grant the Trustee's <orig>الأمين</orig> aforementioned request.

## Therefore, We Have Decided:
The Trustee <orig>الأمين</orig> is authorized to open a bank account in the name of the bankruptcy estate <orig>التفليسة</orig> of / The National Company for Infrastructure Projects Development <orig>الشركة الوطنية لتطوير مشروعات البنية التحتية</orig>, into which the amounts received within the proceedings shall be deposited within ten days of their receipt, provided that a monthly statement of account for those amounts is submitted to the Bankruptcy Administration, and the Bankruptcy Administration shall provide the Trustee <orig>الأمين</orig> with a certified copy of this decision, publish it in the Official Gazette, register it in the Commercial Register <orig>السجل التجاري</orig>, and legally notify the concerned parties.

Secretary <orig>أمين السر</orig>
Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig>

In accordance with Article (8) of the Bankruptcy Law, the decisions issued by the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> shall be considered writs of execution in accordance with this law, and the Bankruptcy Administration shall affix the executory formula to them, and they shall be enforceable immediately upon issuance and without notification.

- Buildings No. (11), (13), and (14) are located at the rear of the resort, opposite Al-Taawun Street, and are separated from the hotel apartment buildings and the administrative building No. (8) by an entrance to the basement car park.
4) The components of the hotel apartment buildings are consistent with what is stated in the real estate report issued by the World Bank, submitted in the case file of the eighth and ninth defendants at the session of 20/9/2021, document (7).
5) The appointed expert inspected the property subject of the lawsuit and reviewed the case file and its documents to submit his report.
There is an investment contract dated 22/10/2017, concluded between the First Party / the heirs of the late Sheikh <orig>الشيخ</orig> / Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah <orig>سعد العبدالله السالم الصباح</orig>, and the Second Party / Argana Hotels and Resorts Company (formerly the Kuwait International Institute for Sports and Health Company), under which the Second Party leased two plots of land:
- Plot (5), Block (13) of Plan M/38640, Rumaithiya Coastal Strip (Rimal Hotel and Resort) with an area of 22,202.1 m2. (The subject of the dispute)
- Plot (7), Block (13) of Plan M/38640, Rumaithiya Coastal Strip (Mövenpick Hotel and Resort) with an area of 30,833.1 m2.
During the term of the contract, the Second Party, at its own expense, utilized the two plots of land to establish a tourist resort that includes hotels, facilities, and commercial projects worth several million, requiring its continued presence on the leased land beyond the expiry date of the current lease agreement, which is valid until 31/12/2023. The parties have the right to conclude another contract before the end of the current one, to become effective from 1/1/2024 for a period of 25 years. The third clause stipulated that the annual rental value for the two plots of land is KWD 2,250,000 (two million, two hundred and fifty thousand Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>), to be increased every six years as detailed in the aforementioned third clause of the contract.

From the foregoing detailed statement, it became clear to the committee that the property subject of the lawsuit is the Arjan Al-Bidaa Resort (formerly Al-Rimal) and that the possessor of the property is Argana Hotels and Resorts Company, the ninth defendant, which has the right of usufruct under the aforementioned investment contract, and it is operated as a commercial-tourist resort.

Note: Pursuant to the investment contract notarized under No. 2640, Volume 3, dated 22/10/2017, and in accordance with Article Nine of the said contract, the party declares on its own behalf and in its capacity that it is not permissible to place any mortgage on the facilities established on the land, nor to create any rights thereon for third parties throughout the term of the aforementioned contract (this restriction is recorded in the seizure records).

## Observations:
- The property is a hotel resort consisting of 8 hotel apartment buildings and 4 hotel service buildings, including commercial shops. There are some violations on the seafront, including:
- New construction of a bathroom on the southern side with light materials, area 3x6m, as shown in the plan.
- New construction of a storage room with light materials, 3x4m.
- New construction of a separate aluminum and glass hall for a restaurant and cafe, area 22x10m.
- New construction of 10 air-conditioned glass and aluminum domes with a diameter of 3.70m.
- Construction of a room for preparing coffee orders from light materials with a diameter of 3m.
- Construction of a separate room for renting boats, area 4x5m, on the northern side.

Second: The person whose bid is approved by the judge must deposit, during the sale session, the full approved price, expenses, and registration fees.

Fourth: If the bidder deposits the price in the following session, the auction award will be ruled in his favor, unless someone comes forward in this session who agrees to purchase with a ten percent increase, accompanied by a deposit of the full auction price. In this case, the auction will be reopened in the same session on the basis of this new price.
Fifth: If the first bidder does not deposit the full price in the following session and no one comes forward with the ten percent increase, the auction will be immediately reopened at his own risk based on the price that was awarded to him in the previous session. In this session, no bid will be considered unless it is accompanied by a deposit of its full value. The defaulting bidder shall be liable for any shortfall in the property's price.
Sixth: The successful bidder shall, in all cases, bear the fees for the transfer and registration of ownership, the enforcement procedure expenses amounting to KWD 200, legal and expert fees, and the costs of advertising and publishing the sale in daily newspapers.
Seventh: This announcement is published in application of the law. Those initiating the sale procedures do so at their own responsibility, and the Clerk's Office of the Court of First Instance shall bear no liability.
