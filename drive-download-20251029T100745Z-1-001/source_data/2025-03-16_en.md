## Explanatory Memorandum
### For Decree-Law No. 8 of 2025 Amending the Text of Article (251) of the Civil Code Issued by Decree-Law No. (67) of 1980

The Civil Code was issued by Decree-Law No. (67) of 1980, and Article (251), clause (1) stipulated that ((The full Diyah <orig>الدية</orig> shall be estimated at ten thousand dinars. Its amount may be amended by decree)). In explaining this, the memorandum accompanying the Civil Code clarified that ((The origin of Diyah <orig>الدية</orig>, according to the provisions of Islamic Sharia <orig>الشرع الإسلامي</orig>, is determined as one hundred camels. Under this noble Sharia, there is nothing to prevent its amount from being determined in currency. The legislator has permitted the amendment of the monetary amount of the Diyah <orig>الدية</orig> it set, in order to provide the opportunity to keep it consistently aligned with price levels. Amending the monetary amount of the Diyah <orig>الدية</orig> is an established principle in Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh <orig>الفقه الإسلامي</orig>). The evidence for this is what was narrated that the Diyah <orig>الدية</orig> during the era of the Prophet, may God's best prayers be upon him, was eight hundred dinars or eight thousand dirhams, and it remained so until Omar became Caliph. He saw that the prices of camels had risen, so he increased the Diyah <orig>الدية</orig> to one thousand dinars or twelve thousand dirhams (Al-Madhhab, Part 2, p. 210). The draft preferred to make the amendment of the Diyah <orig>الدية</orig> amount by decree, for the sake of speed and ease in its procedure)).

More than forty years have passed since this regulation, during which financial and economic conditions have changed. There has been a noticeable increase in individual income, met with a steady decline in the purchasing power of money, such that the estimate stipulated in the aforementioned article no longer reflects the true amount of the Diyah <orig>الدية</orig> as prescribed by Sharia. Hence, this draft law was introduced to rectify this imbalance, reaffirm the sanctity of life, provide a means for just compensation, and establish reasons for sparing the blood of the innocent, given the undeniable role of the Sharia-prescribed Diyah <orig>الدية الشرعية</orig> in deterring aggressors and discouraging the impulses of others. This necessitated the provision to set the amount of the Sharia-prescribed Diyah <orig>الدية الشرعية</orig> at twenty thousand dinars.

Practical experience has proven the ineffectiveness of referring to a special decree to re-estimate the value of the Sharia-prescribed Diyah <orig>الدية الشرعية</orig> while its value is stipulated in the body of the law. Furthermore, it could lead to ambiguity and legislative instability, which necessitated making this amendment and removing the text that permits amending the Diyah <orig>الدية</orig> amount by decree, and instead relying on the estimate provided in the law.

There is no impediment in Sharia or in law to reconsidering the value of the Sharia-prescribed Diyah <orig>الدية الشرعية</orig> again whenever new justifications arise, but this should be done through clear and organized legislative procedures that ensure the stability of the legal system.

And as the Amiri Order was issued on 2 Dhu al-Qi'dah 1445 H, corresponding to 10 May 2024, and Article (4) thereof stipulates that laws shall be issued by decree-laws, the present draft Decree-Law has been prepared.

Its first article provides for the replacement of clause (1) of Article (251) of the aforementioned Civil Code and raises the value of the Diyah <orig>الدية</orig> to 20 thousand dinars. Its second article obliges both the Council of Ministers and the ministers to implement it and put it into effect from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette.

# Explanatory Memorandum
## For Decree-Law No. 9 of 2025 Repealing the text of Article 153 of the Penal Code issued by Law No. (16) of 1960

Whereas the Constitution, in Article (29), guarantees equality among people in human dignity, and in public rights and duties, and prohibits discrimination among them on the basis of sex, origin, language, or religion; and whereas Article (153) of the Penal Code issued by Law No. 16 of 1960 included a provision for a mitigating legal excuse for the penalty of a man who commits the crime of killing his wife, mother, daughter, or sister upon surprising her in the act of adultery (in flagrante delicto); and whereas restricting this excuse to men and not women constitutes discrimination between them on the basis of sex, on the grounds of the provocation of a man's feelings by this crime, despite the fact that a woman has the same feelings, especially since mitigating the penalty for this crime contributes to its prevalence.

Furthermore, its provision conflicts with the obligations of the State of Kuwait established under international charters and conventions, particularly the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. That Declaration included the establishment of a common standard that states should aim for in defining the rights that must be protected, and affirmed that all are equal in rights, and that both men and women have the right to enjoy them without discrimination based on race, color, or sex, and that they are equal in rights at the time of marriage, during the marriage, and at its dissolution. The Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women also included a provision criminalizing such discrimination and, in its second article, obligated states to take all appropriate measures, including the repeal of provisions of national penal codes that constitute discrimination against women, which necessitates, as previously stated, the repeal of this article due to the discrimination against women it represents, which contradicts the Constitution and Kuwait's international obligations. Therefore, in commitment to this international obligation, and as the Amiri Order was issued on 10 May 2024, with its Article (4) stipulating that laws shall be issued by decree-laws, the present draft Decree-Law has been prepared. Its first article provides for the repeal of the aforementioned Article 153, and its second article obligates all ministers to implement it, publish it in the Official Gazette, and for it to come into force from the date of its publication.

# Explanatory Memorandum
## To Decree-Law No. 10 of 2025 Amending the Text of Article (26) of Law No. (51) of 1984 Regarding Personal Status

Based on the Constitution of the State of Kuwait, which affirms the protection of the family, motherhood, and childhood, and in accordance with the provisions of Islamic Sharia, while also observing Kuwait's international obligations, particularly the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which defines a child as anyone who has not reached the age of eighteen and obligates states to protect them from early marriage, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which ensures the free and full consent of the spouses and encourages setting a minimum age for marriage. Therefore, it was deemed appropriate to replace Article (26) of Law No. (51) of 1984 Regarding Personal Status in a manner that prohibits the documentation of marriage unless both spouses have reached the age of eighteen.

And whereas the Amiri Order was issued on 2 Dhu al-Qi'dah 1445 H, corresponding to 10 May 2024, and stipulated in its Article (4) that laws shall be issued by decree-laws, therefore, the present draft decree-law has been prepared. Its first article provides for the replacement of Article (26) of the aforementioned Law No. (51) of 1984, and prohibits the documentation or ratification of a marriage contract for anyone who has not reached the age of 18 at the time of documentation. Its second article obligates the Prime Minister and the Ministers to implement this decree-law, to be effective from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette.

# Explanatory Memorandum for Decree-Law No. 12 of 2025 Amending Article (2) of Law No. (88) of 1995 Regarding the Trial of Ministers

The Constitutional Court <orig>المحكمة الدستورية</orig> issued its ruling in direct appeal No. (24) of (2015) in its session on 20/12/2015, declaring the unconstitutionality of Decree-Law No. (24) of 2012 on the establishment of the Public Authority for Anti-Corruption <orig>الهيئة العامة لمكافحة الفساد</orig> and the provisions for Financial Disclosure. This led to the annulment of the provision of clause (f) of Article Two of Law No. (88) of 1995 regarding the Trial of Ministers, which was added by Law No. (29) of 2014, stipulating that the crimes provided for in the law ruled unconstitutional fall within its scope of application. This resulted in a legislative vacuum in this regard.

As Law No. (2) of 2016 was issued regarding the establishment of the Public Authority for Anti-Corruption <orig>الهيئة العامة لمكافحة الفساد</orig> and Financial Disclosure to replace the law ruled unconstitutional, and it included an enumeration of the categories subject to its provisions, among them ministers, it became necessary, to achieve the legislator's objectives in issuing the law on the trial of ministers, to consolidate the jurisdiction for investigation and trial concerning crimes attributed to ministers related to their capacity and official duties.

Therefore, it was deemed appropriate to prepare the accompanying draft Decree-Law to amend Article Two of the aforementioned law by replacing the text of clause (f) with another that includes the crimes stipulated in the aforementioned Law No. (2) of 2016.

6. Amendment to the text of Article (27) of the Articles of Association, as follows:
– Text before amendment:
"The Chairman of the Board of Directors and its members are responsible for their actions towards the company, shareholders, and third parties for all acts of fraud, abuse of power, any violation of the provisions of the law or these Articles, and for mismanagement.

Members of the Board of Directors may not participate in voting on General Assembly resolutions related to discharging them from liability for their management, or those related to a special benefit for them, their spouses, or their first-degree relatives, or a dispute between them and the company.
This liability shall be either a personal liability attached to a specific member, or a joint liability among all members of the Board of Directors. In the latter case, all members shall be jointly and severally liable for paying compensation, except for those who objected to the resolution that established the liability and had their objection recorded in the minutes.
Furthermore, the company may file a liability lawsuit against the members of the Board of Directors for errors that result in damages to the company. If the company is in liquidation, the liquidator shall file the lawsuit.
Any shareholder may individually file a liability lawsuit on behalf of the company if the company fails to do so.

A shareholder may also file a personal lawsuit for compensation if the error has caused them harm. Any agreement to the contrary shall be void."

7. Amendment to the text of Article (29) of the Articles of Association, as follows:

If it becomes apparent during the discussion that the information regarding some of the matters presented is insufficient, the meeting must be postponed for a period not exceeding ten days if requested by a number of shareholders representing one-quarter of the issued share capital. The postponed meeting shall be convened without the need for new invitation procedures."

8. Amendment to the text of Article (30) of the Articles of Association, as follows:
– Text before amendment:

There are new additions of commercial shops in residential rooms, and the property is being used for a purpose other than that for which it is licensed, with construction using unauthorized materials.

The complex entrances were locked, and the appellants' agent was unable to open them to allow us to inspect the property from the inside. He was also unable to describe the interior components of the property as he has no information about its details.
- The property subject of the lawsuit consists of two floors (ground + first + an open roof with an annex). There are external shops around the plot, some of which are newly constructed from Kirby material. We found that all shops are currently closed and their facades are covered with plaster.
- The air conditioning is window-type, and there are no parking spaces.

## – Second: Auction Conditions:

**First:** The auction will begin at the starting price. To participate in the auction, a deposit of at least one-fifth of that price must be paid by a certified check from the drawee bank or by a letter of guarantee from a bank in favor of the Enforcement Directorate at the Ministry of Justice <orig>إدارة التنفيذ بوزارة العدل</orig>.

**Second:** The person whose bid is approved by the judge must deposit, during the sale session, the full approved price, expenses, and registration fees.

**Third:** If the person whose bid was approved does not deposit the full price, he must deposit at least one-fifth of the price; otherwise, the auction will be repeated at his expense in the same session based on the price at which the sale had been awarded.
