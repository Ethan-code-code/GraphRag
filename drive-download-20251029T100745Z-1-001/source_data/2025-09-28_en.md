Whereas the aforementioned judgment was published in the Official Gazette – Kuwait Today / Al-Kuwait Al-Youm <orig>الكويت اليوم</orig> – Issue 1714, Year Seventy, on 24/11/2024.

And whereas it has been established from the review of the certificate from the Court of Appeal's clerk's office that no appeal was filed against the aforementioned judgment up to the date of 16/2/2025.

And whereas the bankruptcy judge issued his decision dated 6/4/2025, assigning the bankruptcy trustee to prepare a provisional list of debts for the bankrupt parties.

And whereas the bankruptcy trustee submitted the letters dated 8/5/2025 and 7/9/2025, requesting authorization to sell the shares owned by the bankrupt company in Kuwait Projects Company (Holding) and The First for Local Fuel Marketing Company, noting that the proceeds from the sale of these shares are insufficient to cover the bankruptcy expenses due to the lack of other funds for the bankrupt company. The bankruptcy trustee attached to his aforementioned letters a statement listing the bankrupt company's creditors with a total debt of KWD 266,293.

And whereas the bankruptcy judge issued his decision dated 1/6/2025, assigning the bankruptcy trustee to submit documents proving the lack of funds owned by the bankrupt company, and to provide a statement of all funds owned by each of the bankrupt parties: 1- Mohammed Ali Hamad Al-Shammari <orig>محمد علي حمد الشمري</orig>, 2- Shalwa Dkhan Ajil <orig>شلوى دخان عجيل</orig>, and to clarify the role of the aforementioned bankrupt parties in the lack of sufficient funds in the bankrupt company to settle its debts.

And whereas the bankruptcy trustee submitted his letter dated 18/6/2025, titled "Final Bankruptcy Report," which states that the total outstanding debt owed by all bankrupt parties is an amount of KWD 283,526 (two hundred eighty-three thousand, five hundred and twenty-six Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>), in addition to a debt to the Kuwait Credit Bank of KWD 41,814 (forty-one thousand, eight hundred and fourteen Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>) secured by a mortgage on the property located in the Al-Andalus <orig>الأندلس</orig> area, Plot 5 <orig>قطعة 5</orig>, Parcel 17 <orig>قسيمة 17</orig>, Plan No. 28085, with an area of 910 square meters, of which the bankrupt party, Mohammed Ali Al-Shammari <orig>محمد علي الشمري</orig>, owns a 50% share. The company holds a bank balance with Kuwait Finance House of KWD 250, and a collection of shares and dividend checks as follows: 2,240 shares in Kuwait Projects Company (Holding) and 499 shares in The First for Local Fuel Marketing Company with an approximate total value of KWD 491, and 49 bonus shares in The First for Local Fuel Marketing Company, and cash dividend checks with a total value of KWD 138. The report concluded with a request to close the bankruptcy due to insufficient funds to cover the bankruptcy expenses and debts.

And whereas the bankruptcy judge issued the decision dated 20/7/2025, requesting a statement of the procedures taken regarding the property, Document No. 5739/1992, located in the Al-Andalus <orig>الأندلس</orig> area, Plot 5 <orig>قطعة 5</orig>, Parcel 17 <orig>قسيمة 17</orig>, Plan No. 28085, with an area of 910 square meters, of which the bankrupt party, Mohammed Ali Al-Shammari <orig>محمد علي الشمري</orig>, owns a 50% share, and a statement of the funds remaining for the bankrupt party after enforcement, and to provide the supporting documents.

And whereas the bankruptcy trustee submitted his letter dated 27/7/2025, which confirms the issuance of the judgment in Case No. 2015/275/168 Sales/1 dated 30/11/2020, and its appeal No. 2020/3641 Civil/5 dated 20/1/2020, which ruled to terminate the proceedings for the sale of the aforementioned property.

## Legal Basis:
Whereas Articles (196/198) of the Bankruptcy Law No. 71 of 2020 stipulate that: "If bankruptcy proceedings are suspended due to insufficient funds before the ratification of the judicial composition, the bankruptcy judge may decide to close them. The consequence of closing the bankruptcy due to insufficient funds is that each creditor regains the right to take individual actions and file individual lawsuits. If the creditor's debt has been verified and finally accepted in the bankruptcy, they may enforce it against the debtor in accordance with the provisions of Article (195) of this law. The bankruptcy trustee shall be responsible for a period of one year from the date of the bankruptcy's closure for the documents delivered to him by the creditors."

The Bankruptcy Administration must publish, announce, and register the decision to close the bankruptcy within ten days from the date of its issuance.

## Therefore, we have decided the following:
To close the bankruptcy of the bankrupt parties: 1- Mohammed Ali Hamad Al-Shammari <orig>محمد علي حمد الشمري</orig>. 2- Shalwa Dkhan Ajil <orig>شلوى دخان عجيل</orig>. 3- Al-Sitteen Al-Alamiya for General Trading and Contracting Company / Mohammed Ali Hamad Al-Shammari and his partner – a general partnership, due to the insufficiency of their funds. The Bankruptcy Administration shall notify the concerned parties of the decision, register it in the Commercial Register of the aforementioned company, and publish it in the Official Gazette.

After reviewing the documents and the Inspector's <orig>المفتش</orig> letter dated 31/8/2025 requesting an extension of the inspection mission, and in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Law <orig>قانون الإفلاس</orig> and its Executive Regulations <orig>لائحته التنفيذية</orig>:
The facts are established by what was encompassed in the decision of the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> in the present application, issued on 15/6/2025, appointing the Inspector <orig>المفتش</orig> to perform the tasks set forth in the decision, to which we refer to avoid repetition.
Whereas the text of Article 1 of the Bankruptcy Law <orig>قانون الإفلاس</orig> states that "The Inspector <orig>المفتش</orig>:
A person licensed to carry out the duties of a Trustee <orig>الأمين</orig> who conducts inspections of all the debtor's business and records, or inspects specific operations or facts and submits a report thereon." And the text of Article (51) of the same law states that "The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> may, upon a reasoned request submitted by the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة الإفلاس</orig>, a regulatory body, a creditor, the Observer <orig>المراقب</orig>, the Trustee <orig>الأمين</orig>, or on his own initiative, appoint an Inspector <orig>المفتش</orig> from among the persons who are permitted to carry out the duties of a Trustee <orig>الأمين</orig> or from others, and assign him to inspect all of the debtor's business, assets, or dispositions, or to inspect a specific fact or facts, whenever the request for the appointment of the Inspector <orig>المفتش</orig> relates to a debtor for whose debts an application to initiate proceedings has been filed in accordance with the provisions of this Law. In the event a Trustee <orig>الأمين</orig> or an Observer <orig>المراقب</orig> is appointed, the Trustee <orig>الأمين</orig> or the Observer <orig>المراقب</orig>, as the case may be, shall undertake the inspection mission. The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> shall decide on the application within ten days from the date of its submission to the Bankruptcy Administration <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig>. The decision appointing the Inspector <orig>المفتش</orig> shall specify the mission entrusted to him, his competencies, powers, and fees, if he is not one of those appointed as a Trustee <orig>الأمين</orig> or Observer <orig>المراقب</orig>. In this case, the provisions of Articles (34, 35) of this Law shall apply to him. The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> may authorize the Inspector <orig>المفتش</orig> to seek assistance from whomever he deems necessary to accomplish the mission entrusted to him. Article (49) of this Law shall apply to the Inspector's <orig>المفتش</orig> fees. The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> may require the creditor who requested the inspection to pay such fees in advance, to be recovered from the debtor's assets if the Inspector <orig>المفتش</orig> concludes that the facts on which the creditor based the inspection request are valid." And the text of Article (52) thereof states that "The Inspector <orig>المفتش</orig>, in the course of carrying out the mission assigned to him, may request to hear the testimony of any person without an oath. He may also request any information or documents from the debtor, any of the creditors, units subject to the Central Bank <orig>البنك المركزي</orig>, persons licensed by the Authority <orig>الهيئة</orig>, regulatory bodies, or any other governmental or non-governmental entity.
If the aforementioned person or entity deems that such testimony, information, or documents are not relevant to the mission assigned to the Inspector <orig>المفتش</orig>, he must submit a request to the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> within ten days from the date of being notified of the Inspector's <orig>المفتش</orig> request, seeking exemption from all or part of what the Inspector <orig>المفتش</orig> has requested. The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> shall issue his decision on the request within ten days from the date of its submission, and his decision shall be final." And the text of Article (53) states that "The Inspector <orig>المفتش</orig> must complete the mission he is assigned to carry out and submit a report to the Bankruptcy Administration <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> explaining how it was executed and the results he reached, within the deadlines specified in his appointment decision. The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> may extend the execution of the mission upon the Inspector's <orig>المفتش</orig> request."
Guided by the foregoing, and as the appointed Inspector <orig>المفتش</orig> has requested approval for an extension of the inspection mission assigned to him for an additional two months to enable him to complete his mission and execute it in the fullest manner, due to the vast volume of data and documents required to be examined for the period from 2013 to the present date, and the requirements of in-depth auditing, analysis, and evaluation that the mission entails, as the originally estimated period is insufficient to complete the required work optimally; and since granting the Inspector's <orig>المفتش</orig> request will enable him to accomplish the scope of his work in completing the inspection procedures and will serve the interests of the creditors and the present application, we therefore grant the Inspector's <orig>المفتش</orig> request by issuing the aforementioned extension decision.

Therefore, we have decided:
To extend the period of the inspection work established by the decision of the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> issued on 15/6/2025 for an additional two months, effective from the expiry date of the aforementioned previous decision. The Bankruptcy Administration <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> shall publish this decision in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>, record it in the Commercial Register <orig>السجل التجاري</orig>, and legally notify the concerned parties of this decision.
In accordance with Article (8) of the Bankruptcy Law <orig>قانون الإفلاس</orig>, decisions issued by the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> shall be considered enforceable instruments <orig>سندات تنفيذية</orig> under this Law. The Bankruptcy Administration <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> shall affix the writ of execution <orig>الصيغة التنفيذية</orig> to them, and they shall be enforceable immediately upon issuance and without notification.

## (Decision)
On Thursday, 11/9/2025, at the headquarters of the Bankruptcy Administration, with the membership of Mr. Omran Mohammed Al-Kandari <orig>عمران محمد الكندري</orig> and in the presence of Mr. Yousef Al-Bakr <orig>يوسف البكر</orig>.

3- Warba Bank <orig>بنك وربة</orig>
4- Al Mulla Finance Company <orig>شركة الملا للتمويل</orig>
5- Industrial Bank
6- And others

The summary of the facts is that the applicant, Penta Furniture and Furnishings Company (W.L.L.), submitted a request to the Bankruptcy Administration in its capacity as a (debtor) for a settlement against 1- Kuwait Finance House, 2- Ahli United Bank – currently Kuwait Finance House, 3- Warba Bank, 4- Al Mulla Finance Company, 5- Industrial Bank, and others.
Furthermore, the applicant company's business is capable of continuing, based on a technical study of its goods by Crowe Kuwait Consulting, an office registered with regulatory authorities. The debtor applicant has a plan to continue its activities, has future cash flows, and the creditors are holders of ordinary debts. The total bank debts amount to two million, five hundred eighty-nine thousand and forty-one dinars; the total supplier debts amount to one million, eight hundred forty-three thousand and eleven dinars; and the total employee debts amount to one million, four hundred thirty-four thousand, three hundred and sixteen dinars. There are debts to other parties amounting to one million, six hundred thirty-eight thousand and seven dinars. The book value of fixed assets is 650,357 dinars. There are methods to amortize the accumulated losses, and there is a financial study with a preventive settlement plan. It has submitted evidence and documents demonstrating its ability to continue operations and amortize its losses in a short period. It submitted document portfolios, the most important of which include (a resolution from an extraordinary general assembly, a letter classifying creditors, amounts due, and guarantees provided, a copy of the list of goods and assets, and financial statements for banks, suppliers, and employees). Consequently, the company became unable to pay its debts as a result of this impediment.
At the session of 26/12/2024, the applicant company's lawyer submitted a defense memorandum and a portfolio of documents demonstrating its ability to continue operations and pay its creditors' debts in light of the preventive settlement plan it submitted. The applicant company had outlined in its request a summary of the proposed preventive settlement and the agreements to be concluded with creditors regarding the settlement. It clarified its desire to be granted sufficient time to settle its outstanding debts in order to preserve the company's entity, the value of its assets, and the interests of its shareholders, while affirming its ability to fulfill all these debts.
At the session of 26/12/2024, a decision was issued by the Bankruptcy Judge (to address the Bankruptcy Committee to examine the request and provide an opinion thereon, stating the feasibility of the preventive settlement, assessing the debtor's financial situation and outstanding debts, stating whether or not precautionary measures should be taken, stating whether or not the debtor is capable of managing its business and funds on its own, and providing us with a detailed report on the matter, working as much as possible to complete this within the legal deadlines stipulated by the Bankruptcy Law, and stating the need to appoint an observer to examine the proposed preventive settlement, the measures taken, and the implementation of its proposal, and in the affirmative case, stating the value of the financial amount due to the observer, whether monthly or annually).
Whereas, a letter was received from the Bankruptcy Committee dated 20/3/2025 stating that it is unable to provide an opinion due to deficiencies in some details, which we refer to in detail to avoid repetition.
Whereas, the applicant's lawyer submitted three document portfolios, a flash memory, and a defense memorandum in response to the Bankruptcy Committee's report and insisted on his requests.
At the session of 14/4/2025, a decision was issued (to re-address the Bankruptcy Committee in light of the final defense memorandum submitted by the applicant, its document portfolios, and the attached flash memory, in response to the Bankruptcy Committee's letter, in order to "examine the request and provide an opinion thereon, stating the feasibility of the preventive settlement, assessing the debtor's financial situation and outstanding debts, stating whether or not precautionary measures should be taken, stating whether or not the debtor is capable of managing its business and funds on its own, and providing us with a detailed report on the matter, working as much as possible to complete this within the legal deadlines stipulated by the Bankruptcy Law, and stating the need to appoint an observer to examine the proposed preventive settlement, the measures taken, and the implementation of its proposal, and in the affirmative case, stating the value of the financial amount due to the observer, whether monthly or annually").

Whereas a letter was received from the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة افلاس</orig> dated 12/6/2025, which includes the acceptance in principle of a preventive settlement <orig>تسوية وقائية</orig> plan and the appointment of a supervisor <orig>مراقب</orig>, to which reference is made to avoid repetition.

And on 12/6/2025, a decision was issued to commence the preventive settlement <orig>تسوية وقائية</orig> procedures, stay all claims, prepare a preventive settlement proposal by the applicant, and form a creditors' committee, to which reference is made in detail.

Likewise, a decision was issued (The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي افلاس</orig> has decided: to appoint Ms. Rabia Saad Al-Muhanna <orig>رابعة سعد المهنا</orig> as a "supervisor <orig>مراقب</orig>" for Penta Furniture and Furnishings Company "L.L.C." <orig>شركة بنتا للأثاث و المفروشات "ذ.م.م"</orig> to follow up on the request for preventive settlement procedures and to oversee the company's financial affairs. She is entitled to a monthly salary of 1,000 K.D. (one thousand dinars) in accordance with the conclusion of the Bankruptcy Committee's <orig>لجنة افلاس</orig> report dated 12/6/2025, effective from today's date, 3/7/2025, until the final decision on this request is issued. This decision is to be published in the Official Gazette, and the Court Clerk's Office shall notify the litigants in this regard), to which reference is made to avoid repetition.

And in the session of 11/9/2025, the applicant's lawyer submitted a letter requesting (approval to extend the stay of judicial claims and enforcement actions taken against Penta Furniture and Furnishings Company L.L.C. <orig>شركة بنتا للأثاث والمفروشات ذ.م.م</orig> for a period of one month), to which reference is made to avoid repetition.

## Legal Basis:
Whereas it is established by the text of Articles (1 and 61) of the Bankruptcy Law <orig>قانون الإفلاس</orig> No. 71 of 2020 that: "For the purposes of applying the provisions of this law, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings indicated next to each: ... Stay of Claims <orig>وقف المطالبات</orig>: The suspension of any lawsuit or enforcement action filed against the debtor, whenever it relates to their assets or debts..." The issuance of a decision to commence preventive settlement procedures results in a stay of claims <orig>وقف المطالبات</orig> for a period of three months following the date of the decision. The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig>, upon the debtor's request, may extend the period of the stay of claims one or more times, provided that each extension does not exceed one month, and in all cases, the total period of the stay of claims must not exceed six months. The Bankruptcy Administration, upon the debtor's request, shall provide them with a certificate of the stay of claims and its duration." And in accordance with Articles (1, 24, 25, 26, 55, 62, 70, 73) of the same law.

## Therefore, we have decided the following:
To extend the period of the stay of all judicial claims and enforcement actions taken against (Penta Furniture and Furnishings Company L.L.C. <orig>شركة بنتا للأثاث والمفروشات ذ.م.م</orig>) for a period of one month, starting from 13/9/2025. The Bankruptcy Administration shall notify the debtor companies, creditors, and the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة الإفلاس</orig> of this decision in accordance with Article (55) of the Bankruptcy Law <orig>قانون الإفلاس</orig> No. 71 of 2020 and publish it in the Official Gazette.

W.L.L. With reference to the assignment by the Court of First Instance <orig>المحكمة الكلية</orig> pursuant to the judgment issued in Case No. 159/2023 Sales / 3 dated November 23, 2023, regarding the appointment of an auditor (expert) accredited by the Capital Markets Authority <orig>هيئة أسواق المال</orig> to prepare a study report determining the fair value of the shares owned by Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م</orig>, amounting to one share, as of December 31, 2023.
After reviewing the case file and the documents submitted by Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. (W.L.L.) <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات (ذ.م.م)</orig>, including an amendment to the articles of association of a limited liability company dated July 9, 2019, it is clear to us that the share of Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> consists of one share, representing 1% of the total shares of the company.
In light of the information and data obtained from the management and due to the limited purpose of the information received, the information may be incomplete. Therefore, the management of the company under valuation has undertaken to provide this data and information as correct without any verification.
Based on our analysis of the information presented in this report, the underlying assumptions, and based on the net asset value method, the net asset value as of December 31, 2023, was concluded. Consequently, the fair market value of the equity in Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م</orig> as of December 31, 2023, is 7,294,211 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (seven million, two hundred ninety-four thousand, two hundred and eleven Kuwaiti Dinars).
The fair market value of the share of Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> as of December 31, 2023, is an amount of 72,942.11 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (seventy-two thousand, nine hundred and forty-two dinars and eleven Kuwaiti fils) = 7,294,211 ÷ 100 = 72,942.11 Kuwaiti Dinars, with attention drawn to the following:
a) There is a debit balance due from Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in the amount of 1,341,000 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> according to the company data received, listed under the related parties' debit balance, as of December 31, 2023.
b) According to the documents reviewed, submitted by the management of Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م</orig>, a document dated December 27, 2020, was reviewed, which is a contract for the dissolution of a limited liability company pursuant to an appellate court judgment. The legal opinion issued by the Minister of Justice on June 14, 2022, was adopted, according to which the share of Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> was amended, making him the owner of 33 shares instead of one share. Accordingly, if this amendment is taken into account, the total value of these 33 shares would be 2,407,089.63 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (two million, four hundred and seven thousand, eighty-nine Kuwaiti Dinars and sixty-three Kuwaiti fils). Consequently, the net amount remaining for Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> becomes 1,066,089.63 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (one million, sixty-six thousand, eighty-nine Kuwaiti Dinars and sixty-three fils) after deducting the debit balance due from him as of December 31, 2023.
In accordance with the court's decision regarding the appointment of the expert dated November 23, 2023, which is to estimate the value of only one share, we have valued the company and determined the value of the single share of Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig>, and the matter is left to the court to consider the other documents and issued judgments.
The present study should be read in light of the required assignment concerning the preparation of a study to determine the fair value of the shares owned by Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> as of December 31, 2023. This study has been prepared in good faith based on the technical and financial information provided by the management of Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> as of the date of this study, without any independent verification and/or due diligence examination of such data/information. The study is considered confidential, and no one has the right to quote it in whole or in part, or to refer to it, without prior written consent from the office.
While our work included an analysis of financial information, it did not include an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The financial information contained in this report has not been subjected to examination and confirmation procedures. Therefore, we assume no responsibility and make no undertaking as to the accuracy and completeness of any information provided to us, and no confirmation has been made thereof.

W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> However, because events and circumstances may not occur as expected, there will usually be differences between the expected results and the actual results, and this difference may be material. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the conformity of the actual results with what is expected, and we do not assume any responsibility nor accept any obligation of any kind for the achievement of the expected results.

### 1.8. Date of Value
The valuation was conducted as of December 31, 2023.

### 1.9. Conclusion of Value
In our opinion, based on our analysis of the information presented in this report, the underlying assumptions, and using the net asset value method, the net asset value as of December 31, 2023, has been concluded. Accordingly, the fair value of the equity in Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. L.L.C. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> as of December 31, 2023, is estimated at 7,294,211 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (seven million, two hundred ninety-four thousand, two hundred eleven Kuwaiti Dinars).
Therefore, the value of a single share is estimated at 72,942.11 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (seventy-two thousand, nine hundred forty-two dinars and eleven Kuwaiti fils) = 7,294,211 / 100 = 72,942.11 Kuwaiti Dinars.
Upon reviewing the case documents and the documents submitted by Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. (L.L.C.), including the amendment to the limited liability company contract dated July 9, 2019, it is clear to us that the share of Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. L.L.C. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> consists of one share, representing 1% of the total shares of the company.
The fair market value of the share of Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. L.L.C. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> as of December 31, 2023, is an amount of 72,942.11 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (seventy-two thousand, nine hundred forty-two dinars and eleven Kuwaiti fils).
It is necessary to draw attention to the following:
a) There is a debit balance due from Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in the amount of 1,341,000 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>, according to the company's data received, listed under the related parties' debit balance as of December 31, 2023.
b) According to the documents reviewed, submitted by the management of Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. L.L.C. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig>, a document dated December 27, 2020, was reviewed, which is a contract for the dissolution of a limited liability company by virtue of an appellate court ruling. The legal opinion issued by the Minister of Justice <orig>وزير العدل</orig> on June 14, 2022, was adopted, according to which the share of Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> was amended, making him the owner of 33 shares instead of one share. Accordingly, if this amendment is taken into account, the total value of those 33 shares would be 2,407,089.63 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (two million, four hundred seven thousand, eighty-nine Kuwaiti dinars and sixty-three Kuwaiti fils). Consequently, the net amount due to Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> becomes 1,066,089.63 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (one million, sixty-six thousand, eighty-nine Kuwaiti dinars and sixty-three fils) after deducting the debit balance due from him as of December 31, 2023.
In accordance with the court's decision regarding the appointment of the expert dated November 23, 2023, which was to estimate the value of only one share, we have valued the company and determined the value of the single share for Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig>. The matter is left to the court to consider other documents and rulings.
This valuation is subject to the assumptions and limiting conditions presented in the attached sections of this report. The valuation summary should be read in conjunction with the detailed valuation report presented in the following pages.

# 5. Valuation
## 5.1 Valuation Approaches / Methods
- There are three traditional valuation approaches: the income approach, the market approach, and the cost or asset approach. Professionals differ on the classification or identification of valuation methods within these three types. However, it is generally agreed that all valuation methods can be described as one of these approaches, a combination of two, or more of these approaches.

### 5.1.1 Income Approach
- The income approach is based on the economic principle of expectation. In this approach, the value of the investment subject to valuation is the present value of the economic income expected to be generated by the investment. For valuation purposes, the measure of economic income being analyzed can be defined in several ways.

### 5.1.2 Market Approach
- The market approach is a method of determining an indication of the value of a business, ownership interest, security, or intangible asset by using one or more methods that compare the subject to similar businesses, ownership interests, securities, or intangible assets that have been sold. Generally, this can be accomplished by comparison with publicly traded companies or by analyzing actual transactions of similar sold businesses. It may also include analyzing previous transactions in the company's shares (if any).

### 5.3.1 Asset Approach
- The asset approach is based on the value of net assets less liabilities, as it is commonly used. This approach starts with the balance sheet book values as close as possible to the valuation date, and the assets and liabilities, including unrecorded ones, are restated to fair value.
Different valuation methods involving one or more of the three categories of valuation approaches can be used. In any valuation study, all applicable methods must be considered, and the most proven method or methods for valuing the property subject to valuation and appropriate for the valuation study should be selected.

## 5.2 The Selected Approach/Method
- The valuation approach we have adopted to determine the fair value of the equity in the company is the Asset Approach (Net Asset Value Method). This is because Mahmoud Haidar & Sons General Trading & Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ. م. م</orig> has no current operating elements, and its value lies in its net assets and current investments.

## 5.3 Asset Approach (Net Asset Value Method)
- The fair value of the equity in Mahmoud Haidar & Sons General Trading & Contracting Co. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات</orig> was determined using the Net Asset Value method under the Asset Approach, detailed as follows:
! Analysis of the unaudited management financial data from the company's operations for the year 2013.
!! Comparison of the book values of tangible assets with the adjusted values.
!!! Classification of the net asset value in a table.
The following table summarizes the calculation of the net asset value.

W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> as of December 31, 2023, is 8,581,424 Kuwaiti Dinar (Eight million, five hundred eighty-one thousand, four hundred and twenty-four Kuwaiti Dinars). Taking into account a discount factor of 15%, the value becomes 7,294,211 Kuwaiti Dinar (Seven million, two hundred ninety-four thousand, two hundred and eleven Kuwaiti Dinars).
- Therefore, the value of a single share is estimated at 72,942.11 Kuwaiti Dinar (Seventy-two thousand, nine hundred and forty-two Kuwaiti Dinars and eleven Kuwaiti fils) – 7,294,211 ÷ 100 = 72,942.11 Kuwaiti Dinar.
- Upon reviewing the case file and the documents submitted by Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. (W.L.L.) <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات (ذ.م.م)</orig>, including an amendment to the articles of association of a limited liability company dated July 9, 2019, it is clear to us that the share of Maytham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> consists of one share, representing 1% of the total shares of the company.
- The fair market value of the share of Maytham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> as of December 31, 2023, is an amount of 72,942.11 Kuwaiti Dinar (Seventy-two thousand, nine hundred and forty-two Kuwaiti Dinars and eleven Kuwaiti fils).
It is necessary to draw attention to the following:
1) There is a debit balance due from Mr. Maytham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> amounting to 1,341,000 Kuwaiti Dinar, according to the company's data received, listed under the related parties' debit balance as of December 31, 2023.
b) According to the documents reviewed, submitted by the management of Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig>, a document dated December 27, 2020, was reviewed, which is a contract for the dissolution of a limited liability company by virtue of an appellate court ruling. The legal opinion issued by the Minister of Justice on June 14, 2022, was adopted, according to which the share of Mr. Maytham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> was amended, so he now owns 33 shares instead of one share. Accordingly, if this amendment is taken into account, the total value of those 33 shares would be an amount of
