Second: Approval was granted to amend the text of Article (47) – (Amended) of the company's Articles of Association to read as shown below:
Text before amendment:
1- A percentage of not less than ten percent of the net profits shall be deducted annually, by a resolution of the Ordinary General Assembly based on a proposal by the Board of Directors, to form a statutory reserve for the company. The Assembly may suspend this deduction if the statutory reserve exceeds half of the company's issued capital.
2. A percentage not exceeding ten percent of the net profits may be deducted annually, by a resolution of the Ordinary General Assembly based on a proposal by the Board of Directors, to form an optional reserve allocated for purposes determined by the Assembly.
3. The Ordinary General Assembly must decide to deduct a percentage of the profits to meet the obligations incumbent upon the company under labor and social security laws. A special fund may be established to assist the company's workers and employees.
Text after amendment:
The net profits shall be distributed as follows:
1 – A percentage of not less than ten percent of the net profits shall be deducted annually, by a resolution of the Ordinary General Assembly based on a proposal by the Board of Directors, to form a statutory reserve for the company. The Assembly may suspend this deduction if the statutory reserve exceeds half of the company's issued capital.
The statutory reserve may only be used to cover the company's losses or to secure the distribution of dividends to shareholders at a rate not exceeding five percent of the paid-up capital in years when the company's profits do not permit the distribution of this percentage, due to the absence of an optional reserve that would allow for the distribution of this percentage of profits. Whatever is deducted from the statutory reserve must be returned to it when the profits of subsequent years permit, unless this reserve exceeds half of the issued capital.
2 – A percentage of 1% (one percent) of the company's annual net profits shall be deducted for the benefit of the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences <orig>مؤسسة الكويت للتقدم العلمي</orig> in accordance with the Amiri Decree issued on December 12, 1976.
All amendments are subject to the approval of the competent regulatory authorities.
The chairman of the meeting extended his sincere thanks to the attending shareholders, and the Extraordinary General Assembly meeting concluded at 11:25 AM on the same day.
Chairman of the Board of Directors

W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ م م</orig>, amounting to one share, as of December 31, 2023.
After reviewing the case file and the documents submitted by Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. (W.L.L.) <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات (ذ.م.م)</orig>, including an amendment to the articles of association of a limited liability company dated July 9, 2019, it is clear to us that the share of Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> consists of one share, representing 1% of the total shares of the company.
In light of the information and data obtained from the management and due to the limited purpose of the information received, the information may be incomplete. Therefore, the management of the company under valuation has undertaken to provide this data and information as correct without any verification.
Based on our analysis of the information presented in this report, the underlying assumptions, and using the net asset value method, the net asset value as of December 31, 2023, was concluded. Consequently, the fair market value of the equity in Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> as of December 31, 2023, is 7,294,211 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (seven million, two hundred ninety-four thousand, two hundred and eleven Kuwaiti Dinars).
The fair market value of the share of Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> as of December 31, 2023, is an amount of 72,942.11 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (seventy-two thousand, nine hundred forty-two Dinars and eleven Kuwaiti fils) = 7,294,211 ÷ 100 = 72,942.11 Kuwaiti Dinars, with attention drawn to the following:
a) There is a debit balance due from Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in the amount of 1,341,000 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>, according to the data received from the company, listed under the related parties' debit balance as of December 31, 2023.
b) According to the documents reviewed, submitted by the management of Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig>, a document dated December 27, 2020, was reviewed. It is a contract for the dissolution of a limited liability company pursuant to an appellate court judgment. The legal opinion issued by the Minister of Justice on June 14, 2022, was adopted, under which the share of Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> was amended, making him the owner of 33 shares instead of one share. Accordingly, if this amendment is taken into account, the total value of these 33 shares would be 2,407,089.63 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (two million, four hundred seven thousand, eighty-nine Kuwaiti Dinars and sixty-three fils). Consequently, the net amount outstanding to Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> becomes 1,066,089.63 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (one million, sixty-six thousand, eighty-nine Kuwaiti Dinars and sixty-three fils) after deducting the debit balance due from him as of December 31, 2023.
In accordance with the court's decision regarding the appointment of the expert dated November 23, 2023, which is to estimate the value of only one share, we have valued the company and determined the value of the single share of Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig>. The matter is left to the court to consider the documents and other issued judgments.
This study should be read in light of the required assignment concerning the preparation of a study to determine the fair value of the shares owned by Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> as of December 31, 2023. This study has been prepared in good faith based on the technical and financial information provided by the management of Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> as of the date of this study, without any independent verification and/or due diligence of said data/information. The study is confidential, and no one has the right to quote it in whole or in part, or to refer to it without prior written consent from the office.
While our work included an analysis of financial information, it did not include an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.

Therefore, we assume no responsibility and make no undertaking as to the accuracy and completeness of any information received by us, and no confirmation has been made thereof.

### 1.8. Date of Valuation
The valuation was conducted as of December 31, 2023.

### 1.9. Conclusion of Value
In our opinion, based on our analysis of the information presented in this report, the underlying assumptions, and using the net asset value method, the net asset value as of December 31, 2023, has been concluded. Accordingly, the fair value of the equity in Mahmoud Haider and Sons for General Trading and Contracting W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> as of December 31, 2023, is estimated at 7,294,211 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (seven million, two hundred ninety-four thousand, two hundred and eleven Kuwaiti Dinars).

Consequently, the value of a single share is estimated at 72,942.11 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (seventy-two thousand, nine hundred forty-two Kuwaiti Dinars and eleven fils) = 7,294,211 ÷ 100 = 72,942.11 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>.
Upon reviewing the case documents and the documents submitted by Mahmoud Haider and Sons for General Trading and Contracting (W.L.L.), including the amendment to the limited liability company contract dated July 9, 2019, it is clear to us that the share of Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in Mahmoud Haider and Sons for General Trading and Contracting W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> consists of one share, representing 1% of the total shares of the company.
The fair market value of the share of Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in Mahmoud Haider and Sons for General Trading and Contracting W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> as of December 31, 2023, is an amount of 72,942.11 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (seventy-two thousand, nine hundred forty-two Kuwaiti Dinars and eleven fils).
It is necessary to draw attention to the following:
a) There is a debit balance due from Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in the amount of 1,341,000 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>, according to the company's data received, listed under the related party receivables balance as of December 31, 2023.
b) According to the documents reviewed, submitted by the management of Mahmoud Haider and Sons for General Trading and Contracting W.L.L., a document dated December 27, 2020, was reviewed, which is a contract for the dissolution of a limited liability company pursuant to an appellate court ruling. The legal opinion issued by the Minister of Justice <orig>وزير العدل</orig> on June 14, 2022, was adopted, under which the share of Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> was amended, making him the owner of 33 shares instead of one share. Accordingly, if this amendment is taken into account, the total value of those 33 shares would be 2,407,089.63 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (two million, four hundred seven thousand, eighty-nine Kuwaiti Dinars and sixty-three fils). Consequently, the net amount due to Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> would be 1,066,089.63 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (one million, sixty-six thousand, eighty-nine Kuwaiti Dinars and sixty-three fils) after deducting the debit balance due from him as of December 31, 2023.
In accordance with the court's decision regarding the appointment of the expert dated November 23, 2023, which was to estimate the value of only one share, we have valued the company and determined the value of the single share for Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haider Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig>. The matter is left to the court to consider the other documents and issued rulings.

# 5. Approaches / Valuation Methods
## 5.1 Valuation Approaches
- There are three traditional valuation approaches: the Income Approach, the Market Approach, and the Cost or Asset Approach. Professionals may differ on the classification or definition of valuation methods within these three types. However, it is generally agreed that all valuation methods can be described as one of these approaches, or a combination of two or more of them.
### 5.1.1 Income Approach
- The Income Approach is based on the economic principle of expectation. In this approach, the value of the investment being valued is the present value of the economic income expected to be generated by the investment. For valuation purposes, the measure of economic income being analyzed can be defined in several ways.
### 5.1.2. Market Approach
- The Market Approach is a method of determining an indication of the value of a business, an ownership interest in a business, a security, or an intangible asset by using one or more methods that compare the subject to similar businesses, ownership interests, securities, or intangible assets that have been sold. Generally, this can be accomplished by comparison with publicly traded companies or by analyzing an actual transaction of a similar sold business. It may also include analyzing previous transactions in the company's shares (if any).
### 5.1.3 Asset Approach
- The Asset Approach is based on the value of net assets less liabilities. As commonly used, this approach begins with the balance sheet book values as of the nearest possible date to the valuation date, and the assets and liabilities, including unrecorded ones, are restated to fair value.
Different valuation methods involving one or more of the three valuation approach categories may be used in any valuation study. All applicable methods must be considered, and the most proven method or methods for valuing the subject property and appropriate for the valuation study should be selected.
## 5.2 The Selected Approach/Method
- The following valuation approach we have adopted to determine the fair value of the equity in the company is the Asset Approach (Net Asset Value Method). This is because Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> has no current operating elements, and its value lies in its net assets and current investments.
## 5.3 Asset Approach (Net Asset Value Method)
- The fair value of the equity in Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> has been determined using the Net Asset Value method under the Asset Approach, detailed as follows:
! Analysis of the unaudited management financial statements of the company for the year 2023.
!! Comparison of the book values of tangible assets with the adjusted values.
!!! Classification of the net asset value in a table.
The following table summarizes the calculation of the net asset value.

# Notes
1- This represents the outstanding balances of trade debtors, which have been reduced by 50% as a precautionary measure due to substantial doubt about the company's ability to collect these balances, given the lack of current activity.
2- The value of real estate investments has been reduced by 30% due to the inability to determine the market value of these investments.
3- The value of available-for-sale financial investments has been reduced by 50% due to the inability to determine the market value of these investments.
# 6. Conclusion
- Based on our analysis of the information presented in this report, the underlying assumptions, and using the Net Asset Value method, the net asset value as of December 31, 2023, has been determined. Consequently, the fair value of the equity in Mahmoud Haider and Sons General Trading and Contracting Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة محمود حيدر وأولاده للتجارة العامة والمقاولات ذ.م.م.</orig> as of December 31, 2023, is estimated to be 8,581,424 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (Eight million, five hundred eighty-one thousand, four hundred and twenty-four Kuwaiti Dinars). After applying a discount factor of 15%, the value becomes 7,294,211 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (Seven million, two hundred ninety-four thousand, two hundred and eleven Kuwaiti Dinars).
- Therefore, the value of a single share is estimated at 72,942.11 Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>, two

11 Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>.

- After reviewing the case file and the documents submitted by Mahmoud Haidar & Sons General Trading and Contracting Company (W.L.L.), including an amendment contract for a limited liability company dated July 9, 2019, it is clear to us that the share of Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haidar Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in Mahmoud Haidar & Sons General Trading and Contracting Company W.L.L. consists of one share, representing 1% of the total shares of the company.
- The fair market value of the share of Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haidar Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in Mahmoud Haidar & Sons General Trading and Contracting Company W.L.L., as of December 31, 2023, is an amount of 72,942.11 Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (seventy-two thousand nine hundred forty-two Kuwaiti Dinar and eleven fils).

It is necessary to draw attention to the following:
1. There is an outstanding debit balance owed by Mr. / Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haidar Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in the amount of 1,341,000 Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>, according to the data received from the company, listed under the related parties' debit balance as of December 31, 2023.
2. b) According to the documents reviewed, submitted by the management of Mahmoud Haidar & Sons General Trading and Contracting Company W.L.L., a document dated December 27, 2020, was reviewed, which is a contract for the dissolution of a limited liability company pursuant to an appellate court ruling. The legal opinion issued by the Minister of Justice <orig>وزير العدل</orig> on June 14, 2022, was adopted, under which the share of Mr. / Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haidar Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> was amended, making him the owner of 33 shares instead of one share. Accordingly, if this amendment is taken into account, the total value of those 33 shares would be 2,407,089.63 Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (two million, four hundred seven thousand, eighty-nine Kuwaiti Dinar and sixty-three fils). Consequently, the net amount due to Mr. / Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haidar Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig> becomes 1,066,089.63 Kuwaiti Dinar <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> (one million, sixty-six thousand, eighty-nine Kuwaiti Dinar and sixty-three fils) after deducting the outstanding debit balance owed by him as of December 31, 2023.
- In accordance with the court's decision to appoint the expert, dated November 23, 2023, which is to estimate the value of only one share, we have valued the company and determined the value of the single share of Mr. / Maitham Mahmoud Haji Haidar Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حاجي حيدر عبد الله</orig>. The matter is left to the court to consider the other submitted documents and rulings.

## Useful Assumptions and Conditions
1. The valuation was performed for the specific purpose mentioned in the 'Purpose of Valuation' section of this report and within the primary scope of work performed by the expert – a licensed Class A auditor, license no. 152 – in estimating the fair value of the shares owned by Mr. Maitham Mahmoud Hami Haidar Abdullah <orig>ميثم محمود حامي حيدر عبد الله</orig> in Mahmoud Haidar & Sons General Trading and Contracting Company W.L.L. as of December 31, 2023.
2. b) The different value estimates presented in this report apply only to this report and cannot be used out of the context presented in this r
