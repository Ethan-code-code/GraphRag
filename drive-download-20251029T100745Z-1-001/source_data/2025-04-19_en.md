*   **Genetic Fingerprint / DNA Fingerprint <orig>البصمة الوراثية</orig>**: It is the map of inherited biological genes that indicates an individual's identity and distinguishes them from others, represented by biological traits or the genetic line of non-coding regions in chromosomal DNA resulting from DNA analysis of biological samples.
*   **Biological Sample <orig>العينة الحيوية</orig>**: The part taken from the human body or its vital secretions for the purpose of comparison to determine identity and assist in identifying relatives of the subject person.
*   **Subject Person <orig>الشخص الخاضع</orig>**: The person concerned with proving or disproving their entitlement to the granting, withdrawal, loss, or revocation of nationality, to be examined by one of the scientific methods stipulated in this Decision to determine their eligibility or non-eligibility for the granting, withdrawal, loss, or revocation of nationality.

*   **Biometric Fingerprint <orig>البصمة البيومترية</orig>**: A type of biotechnology used to identify or verify identity based on unique physiological characteristics of individuals such as fingerprints, iris patterns, facial patterns. This biometric data is collected and used to verify a person's identity and prevent impersonation of other individuals in an accurate and effective manner.

### Article (2)
Modern scientific methods that may be used in granting, withdrawing, losing, or revoking nationality shall be determined in accordance with the foundations and controls specified in this Decision.
These methods include:
1- Analysis of genetic fingerprints or traits.
2- Biometric fingerprints or biological traits.
3- Any other modern scientific method discovered or to be discovered in the future.
