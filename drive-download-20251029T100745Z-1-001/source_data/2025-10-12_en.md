**Article (14):**
"Upon receipt of the notifications stipulated in the preceding article, the Public Authority for Minors' Affairs <orig>الهيئة العامة لشئون القصر</orig> shall take the necessary measures to safeguard the rights of minors or unborn fetuses, and to make an inventory of their immovable and movable assets, all their rights, and all their obligations. An inventory report of these assets, rights, and obligations shall be drawn up, containing a description that removes any ambiguity, to be kept in the estate file. For this purpose, the Authority may open locked premises in the presence of one or more adult heirs after notifying all adult heirs, or in the presence of a member of the Public Prosecution. It may also take possession of and manage the funds and establishments.
The provision of this article shall apply to all others under the care of the Authority."

**Article (18):**
"The court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent them in the pending lawsuit if the interest of a person of incomplete legal capacity, a person lacking legal capacity, a missing person, an absent person, or the charitable third conflicts with the interest of the one who holds guardianship, custodianship, or curatorship over any of them, as the case may be."

**Article (21):**
The Authority's guardianship over those under its care, in accordance with the provisions of this law, shall terminate in the following cases:
1- The minor reaching the full age of twenty-one Gregorian years, unless the court deems it necessary to continue the custodianship upon the request of the Authority or the concerned parties, as well as upon the death of the minor or the return of legal guardianship to the father.
2- The lifting of the interdiction on the interdicted person, the return of the absent or missing person, or the identification of the unknown person, based on a ruling from the competent court.
3- The issuance of a ruling by the competent court to terminate the Authority's guardianship over any of those under its care if it deems it to be in their best interest.
The Authority must hand over the assets in its possession – whether immovable or movable – to the concerned parties whenever its guardianship over any of those under its care ceases, within a period not exceeding six months from the date of its notification thereof. The handover shall be conducted by virtue of a report signed by the Director General of the Authority <orig>المدير العام للهيئة</orig> or his representative. If the concerned parties fail to receive their assets within a period not exceeding three months from the date they are summoned to do so, without an excuse acceptable to the Authority, the Authority shall continue to manage, invest, and grow their assets, provided that in this case it shall charge a percentage determined by the Board of Directors, not to exceed (20%) of the net investment return. The provision of Article (22) of this law shall apply to this amount."

**Article (23):**
"Members of the Authority's Board of Directors and its employees are prohibited from disclosing secrets, information, and data they have obtained in the course of their work.
It is not permissible for them, their spouses, their relatives or in-laws in the direct line of descent up to the second degree, or anyone for whom they act as an agent, custodian, or curator, to purchase or lease any assets belonging to those for whom the Authority acts as custodian or curator, or supervises their custodians or curators, or the assets of the thirds that it manages. Nor may they sell, lease, or exchange any of their own assets with the Authority in this capacity, whether directly or indirectly, even if by public auction.
Any transaction carried out in violation of the preceding paragraph shall be null and void."

**Article Two**
Two new articles, numbered (6 bis, 21 bis), shall be added to the aforementioned Law No. (67) of 1983, with the following text:

**Article (6) bis:**
"The Authority's Board of Directors shall form a permanent committee of representatives from the Public Investment Authority <orig>الهيئة العامة للاستثمار</orig>, who shall be selected based on the nomination and approval of its Board of Directors. This committee shall be exclusively responsible for preparing investment strategies and policies for the funds of minors, persons of incomplete or no legal capacity, the assets of the thirds, and other funds managed by the Authority, as well as for monitoring their implementation and conducting investment operations in all related fields in accordance with the laws regulating this matter and in a manner consistent with the provisions and principles of Islamic Sharia <orig>الشريعة الإسلامية</orig>.
The Minister of Justice – in coordination with the Public Investment Authority <orig>الهيئة العامة للاستثمار</orig> – shall issue a decision on the committee's working system, which shall include its working mechanism and procedures, and all other provisions necessary for the exercise of its competencies."

**Article (21) bis:**
"The Minister of Justice shall issue a decision on the rules, conditions, and procedures by which the summonses and notifications stipulated in Articles (4, 13, 14, 21) of this law are to be carried out."

**Article Three**
The Prime Minister and the Ministers – each within their respective jurisdictions – shall implement this decree-law, which shall be published in the Official Gazette and shall come into force from the date of its publication.

In light of all the foregoing, and as the Amiri Order was issued on 10/5/2024, Article (4) of which stipulated that laws shall be issued by decrees-by-law, it was deemed appropriate to prepare the present draft decree-by-law to amend the provisions of the aforementioned Law No. (67) of 1983.
The first article of the draft stipulated the replacement of Articles (3, 4, 6 last paragraph, 7, 13, 14, 18, 21, 23) of the aforementioned Law No. (67) of 1983 with other texts that include several amendments to the situation in the existing law, as follows:

**First:** Reconstituting the Authority's Board of Directors in a manner that ensures the representation of entities relevant to the Authority's work on its board, thereby guaranteeing its performance effectiveness. The board will be chaired by the Minister of Justice, with the membership of the Authority's Director General <orig>المدير العام</orig> as Vice-Chairman, and three part-time members representing the Public Investment Authority <orig>الهيئة العامة للاستثمار</orig>, the General Secretariat of Awqaf <orig>الأمانة العامة للأوقاف</orig>, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry <orig>وزارة التجارة والصناعة</orig>, from among those holding leadership positions and their equivalents. They shall be nominated by their respective employers, and a decision shall be issued by the Council of Ministers – upon the proposal of the Minister of Justice – to second them for a term of four years, renewable once.

**Second:** Providing a more detailed regulation for the mechanism of convening the Authority's Board of Directors' meetings and its exercise of duties, in a manner that ensures the smooth, regular, and consistent conduct of meetings and keeps pace with the changes in the Board's composition. Meetings shall only be held upon the invitation of the Chairman or his deputy. At least three members must attend the meeting, including the Chairman or his deputy. The Board's decisions must be issued by a majority of the members present. If the votes are tied, the side of the Chairman shall prevail. The Board of Directors is granted the right to seek the assistance of specialists and experts it deems necessary for matters requiring their expertise, without those whose assistance is sought having the right to vote. The remuneration for those whose assistance is sought shall be determined by a decision of the Board of Directors.

**Third:** Granting the Authority's Board of Directors the right to form one or more committees from among its members or others to decide on certain matters within its jurisdiction. The Board shall specify in its decision the issues to be presented to each committee, its scope of jurisdiction, its powers, and the procedures for its meetings and decision-making. This is a change from the existing law, which limited committee formation to members of the Board of Directors. This amendment allows for the inclusion of non-members in these committees when necessary. The draft has deemed it appropriate to leave the provisions, regulations, conditions, and all related matters concerning these committees to a decision issued by the Board of Directors based on its assessment and judgment.

**Fourth:** Granting the Authority the right – with the permission of its Board of Directors – to conduct or liquidate commercial, industrial, or agricultural businesses, lease real estate, and invest or liquidate funds, whether by itself or through third parties, which provides it with the flexibility to choose the appropriate mechanism to do so.

**Fifth:** Requiring adult heirs and partners in assets to notify the Authority within two weeks of the death of any person who died leaving minors or an unborn fetus, of the birth of this fetus, and of the death or absence of the guardian or chosen trustee. This is a change from the existing law, which required them to notify the Mukhtar <orig>مختار</orig> of the area, a position that no longer exists due to the issuance of Decree-by-Law No. (5) of 2024 abolishing Law No. (40) of 1966 concerning Mukhtars <orig>المختارين</orig>.

**Sixth:** Requiring all persons and entities to provide the Authority with the data and documents in their possession that it requests and that are necessary for the exercise of its jurisdictions, in a manner

**Seventh:** Obligating the Authority to prepare an inventory report of the assets, rights, and obligations immediately upon receiving notifications regarding its receipt of the funds of those under its care. This report shall include all necessary details to identify them in a manner that precludes any ambiguity, and it shall be kept in the estate file to ensure the Authority safeguards the funds of those under its care.

**Eighth:** Granting the court the right to appoint a litigation guardian in the event of a conflict of interest between a person of incomplete capacity, a person lacking capacity, a missing person, an absent person, or a charitable third (`الثلث الخيري`) and the interest of the person who holds guardianship, custodianship, or curatorship over any of them, as the case may be, to represent them in the pending lawsuit. This is in contrast to the existing law, which limited this right of the court to persons of incomplete capacity only, excluding other cases, despite the similarity of the underlying reason, which necessitated explicitly stipulating it.

**Ninth:** Adding other cases upon the occurrence of which the Authority's guardianship over those under its care terminates, in accordance with the provisions of this Decree-Law. This is done by explicitly stipulating the case of the return of the absent or missing person, or the identification of the unknown person, based on a ruling from the competent court, while also granting the competent court the right to terminate the Authority's guardianship over any of those under its care if it deems it to be in their best interest, in any other case besides those mentioned in this law.

**Tenth:** Balancing the interest of the Authority in not being burdened with managing, investing, and developing funds over which its guardianship has ended, with urging the concerned parties to promptly receive their funds. The Authority shall be obligated to hand over the funds in its possession, whether real or movable, to the concerned parties once its guardianship over any of those under its care has ceased, within a period not exceeding six months from the date of its notification thereof. If the concerned parties fail to receive their funds within a period not exceeding three months from the date they were called to do so, without an excuse acceptable to the Authority, the present draft has deemed it appropriate to grant the Authority the right to manage, invest, and develop their funds. In this case, it shall charge a percentage determined by the Board of Directors, on the condition that it does not exceed (20%) of the net investment return, to be allocated for what serves the public benefit for all the purposes for which it was established.

**Eleventh:** Ensuring the non-disclosure of the Authority's secrets and preventing conflicts of interest between the members of the Board of Directors and the employees of the Authority and the interests and funds of those under its care. This is achieved by expanding the scope of the prohibition stipulated in the existing law, such that the present draft Decree-Law includes a provision stating that it is not permissible for members of the Authority's Board of Directors or its employees to disclose any of the Authority's secrets they have become aware of by virtue of their work. Nor is it permissible for them, their spouses, or any of their relatives or in-laws in the direct line of descent up to the second degree, or for anyone for whom they act as an agent, custodian, or curator, to purchase or lease any property from the funds of those over whom the Authority holds custodianship or curatorship, or supervises their custodians or curators, or from the funds of the thirds (`الأثلاث`) it manages. Nor may they sell, lease to it in this capacity, or exchange with it any of their own property, whether directly or indirectly, even if through a public auction. This is in contrast to the existing law, which limited the prohibition to members of the Board of Directors and its employees only, without addressing the disclosure of secrets.

Article Two of the present draft Decree-Law stipulated the addition of two new articles to the aforementioned Law No. (67) of 1983, numbered (6 bis, 21 bis). Article (6 bis) stipulated that the Authority's Board of Directors shall form a permanent committee of representatives from the Public Investment Authority <orig>الهيئة العامة للاستثمار</orig>, nominated by it, which shall have the supreme authority in determining the rules and programs for investing the funds managed by the Authority. It was deemed appropriate to delegate the Minister of Justice <orig>وزير العدل</orig>, in coordination with the Public Investment Authority <orig>الهيئة العامة للاستثمار</orig>, to issue a decision regulating all provisions necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction. Meanwhile, Article (21 bis) entrusted the Minister of Justice <orig>وزير العدل</orig> with the authority to issue a decision that includes the necessary rules, conditions, and procedures for sending and receiving all summonses and notifications stipulated in Articles (4, 13, 14, 21) of the aforementioned Law No. (67) of 1983, in a manner that ensures the objective of this procedure is achieved, especially as some of them result in financial and punitive consequences of utmost importance, as set forth in this law.

Article Three of the presented draft Decree-Law obligates the Prime Minister <orig>رئيس مجلس الوزراء</orig> and the Ministers - each within their respective jurisdictions - to implement it, and it shall come into force from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette.

The plaintiff, Aman Takaful Insurance Company (K.S.C.P.), filed its lawsuit by a statement of claim deposited with the court clerk's office on 20/10/2024 and legally served on the two defendants in their respective capacities, requesting in its conclusion a judgment to:\n\nFirst: To accept the restructuring request in form.\n\nSecond: In substance: To approve the proposed restructuring plan submitted by the plaintiff.\n\nThis is based on the assertion that it is a Kuwaiti public shareholding company established on 23/06/2002, with an authorized, issued, and paid-up capital of KWD 10,000,000/- (ten million Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig>), and is listed on the Boursa Kuwait <orig>بورصة الكويت</orig> securities exchange. Its business has faltered, and it has ceased to pay its debts as they fall due, which prompted it to apply for the initiation of restructuring procedures. The application was registered under No. (105/2024 Restructuring), and a judgment was issued accepting the application and appointing the expert / .................... as the restructuring trustee.\n\nThe trustee commenced his duties and submitted his final report, in which he concluded that the company had ceased paying its commercial debts, was in financial distress, and recommended the approval of the proposed restructuring plan.\n\nWhereas, in the session of 29/12/2024, a preliminary judgment was issued assigning the Department of Experts at the Ministry of Justice <orig>وزارة العدل</orig> a mission as stated in the operative part of that judgment.\n\nThe assigned department undertook its mission and submitted its report, which concluded that: the plaintiff company failed to submit all the required documents, which made it impossible for the appointed expert to provide a technical opinion on the case.\n\nWhereas the court has reviewed the report of the expert appointed by it, which it finds satisfactory and adopts, relying on its reasoning and making it a basis for its judgment.\n\nWhereas, as it is established from the appointed expert's report that the plaintiff company did not comply with the submission of all required documents, which prevented the expert from being able to provide a technical opinion on the case, the court therefore decides to reject the request for approval of the proposed restructuring plan.\n\nWhereas, concerning the costs, the court holds the plaintiff liable for them in accordance with the provisions of Article (119) of the Civil and Commercial Procedure Law.\n\nFor these reasons\n\nThe court has ruled: to reject the request for approval of the proposed restructuring plan, and has ordered the plaintiff to bear the costs."
