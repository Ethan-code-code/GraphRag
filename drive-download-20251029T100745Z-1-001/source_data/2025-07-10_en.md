**Explanatory Memorandum for Law No. (117) of 2020**
**Amending Some Provisions of Law No. (111) of 2013 Regarding Commercial Shop Licenses**

Law No. (111) of 2013 regarding commercial shop licenses was issued with the aim of simplifying and facilitating the procedures for obtaining these licenses, in line with the state's general policy of improving the business environment and encouraging investment.

However, practical application has revealed some legislative shortcomings that have hindered the achievement of these goals. This has been reflected in Kuwait's ranking in the World Bank's <orig>البنك الدولي</orig> report on the ease of doing business, particularly in the "Starting a Business" indicator.

Therefore, this law has been prepared to amend some provisions of the aforementioned Law No. (111) of 2013, to address these shortcomings and keep pace with economic developments. The amendments aim to streamline procedures for obtaining commercial licenses by shortening the documentary cycle and specifying clear and specific timeframes for government agencies to decide on license applications. This is achieved through the single-window system <orig>نظام النافذة الواحدة</orig> at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry <orig>وزارة التجارة والصناعة</orig>, which serves as the single point of contact for investors, handling all procedures on their behalf with other relevant government agencies.

The law consists of three articles, in addition to the enacting article.

Article One replaces the texts of Articles (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12) of Law No. (111) of 2013 with new texts.

The new text of Article (4) stipulates that the license application shall be submitted by the concerned person to the competent department at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry <orig>وزارة التجارة والصناعة</orig> using the form prepared for this purpose, accompanied by the required documents and data specified by the executive regulations. The competent department shall review the application to verify its completeness.

The new text of Article (5) requires the competent department to forward the application to the Kuwait Municipality <orig>بلدية الكويت</orig> and other relevant government bodies to obtain their approvals. It obliges these bodies to provide their response to the competent department regarding the application, either with approval or reasoned rejection, within a period not exceeding five working days from the date of receiving the application. It also establishes that failure to respond within this period shall be considered an implicit approval.

The new text of Article (6) requires the competent department to decide on the application within one working day from the date of receiving the approvals from the relevant government bodies or the expiry of the period specified in the previous article without a response. It mandates that the decision to reject the application must be reasoned. It also establishes that the expiry of this period without a decision from the competent department shall be considered an implicit rejection of the application. The article defers to the executive regulations to specify the procedures for submitting and deciding on the application.

The new text of Article (7) links the issuance of the license to the payment of the prescribed fees. It authorizes the executive regulations to determine the categories of these fees, with the condition that the fee does not exceed one hundred Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>مائة دينار كويتي</orig>.

The new text of Article (8) specifies that the license shall be valid for a period of no less than one year and no more than four years from the date of its issuance, as determined by the applicant. It also allows for the renewal of the license for a similar period or periods upon the applicant's request, after payment of the prescribed fees.

The new text of Article (9) obliges the licensee to notify the competent department of any modification to the license data using the form prepared for this purpose, and it defers to the executive regulations to specify the procedures for this.

The new text of Article (10) permits the transfer of the license to others with the approval of the competent department, provided that the transferee meets the conditions required for obtaining the license. It defers to the executive regulations to specify the procedures for transferring the license.

The new text of Article (11) specifies the cases in which the license shall be canceled.

The new text of Article (12) requires the competent department to maintain a register in which all data related to the licenses it issues are recorded, and it defers to the executive regulations to specify the data to be included in this register.

</header>
Article Two of the law adds a new article, (11 bis), to Law No. (111) of 2013. This new article allows the competent department, upon the request of the applicant, to issue a temporary license for a period of one year to practice a commercial activity, after verifying the availability of the space required for the activity. This is to enable the applicant to complete the requirements of the government agencies. The article also permits the renewal of this temporary license for a similar period, provided that the total duration does not exceed two years. It defers to the executive regulations to specify the procedures and conditions for issuing and renewing the temporary license.

Article Three of the law repeals Articles (13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30) of Law No. (111) of 2013.

Article Four of the law is an executive article that requires the Prime Minister <orig>رئيس مجلس الوزراء</orig> and the Ministers - each within their respective jurisdictions - to implement this law, and it specifies that it shall come into force from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>.
