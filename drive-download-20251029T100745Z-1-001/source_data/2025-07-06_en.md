A fee of five dinars shall be imposed on a request to renew a case after it has been struck off the roll, to shorten the date of its session, or to expedite it from a punitive or consensual stay. The applicant shall be liable for this fee regardless of the outcome of the case.
New fees shall be collected for the case at a rate of 10% of the value of the fee due when it was first filed, if it is re-filed within three months from the date of the judgment deeming it as if it never was or by its abandonment, provided that the subject matter of the case or the litigants therein do not change.

## Article (15)
A request for exemption shall be submitted to the Clerks' Department of the Court of First Instance, accompanied by the supporting documents or copies thereof. The Clerks' Department shall notify the Judicial Fees Department of the request and its documents, for the latter to submit its report thereon.
A committee of three judges shall be formed to decide on the request in the absence of the litigants and without a hearing, unless the committee deems their presence necessary. The committee shall have a secretary who attends its sessions and records its minutes. The committee's decision shall be issued by a majority of its members' votes and shall include its reasoning and the grounds on which it relied to verify the state of incapacity justifying the exemption.
The exemption from fees shall be personal, and its effect shall not extend to the heirs of the exempted person or whoever replaces them.

## Article (16)
The committee referred to in the preceding article may, during the course of the case or after the judgment therein, upon the request of the Judicial Fees Department or the opposing party in the case, revoke the exemption decision if it is proven that the state of incapacity justifying the exemption has ceased.
The court's Clerks' Department shall notify the circuit hearing the case of the revocation decision.

## Article (17)
If the opponent of the exempted person is ordered to pay the fees, he must be claimed from first. If it is not possible to collect them from him, recourse may be had against the exempted person if his state of incapacity has ceased in accordance with the preceding article.

## Article (18, first paragraph):
A fee of five dinars shall be imposed on notices and summonses—other than the service of the statement of claim, the judgment, and other summonses related to the proceedings of a dispute pending before the judiciary—for each person served.

## Article (19)
A fee of half a dinar shall be imposed for each page of a copy of the judgment requested by non-litigants. The same fee shall be imposed for each page requested by the litigants after they have received the first copy, or by others regarding the progress of the case or the judgment therein.

## Article (22)
The courts shall decide on cases and requests for which the fee is paid in advance, or for which a temporary exemption is proven. No case or request may be initiated before this fee is paid. If it is found that it has not been paid, the court shall grant the plaintiff a suitable period for payment. If he fails to pay within that period without an acceptable excuse, a judgment must be issued deeming the case as if it never was.

## Article (23)
The provisions of Article 123 of the aforementioned Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure shall apply to orders for the assessment of fees and grievances against them.
Without prejudice to the rules for exemption from judicial fees, the plaintiff is obligated to pay the fee until a final judgment is rendered against the other party for it.

## Article Two
The following two clauses, (f) and (g), shall be added to the text of Article (4) of the aforementioned Law No. 17 of 1973:
f- Lawsuits for the annulment of judgments by courts, judicial bodies, and arbitrators shall be assessed based on the value awarded in the judgment.
g- The value of requests related to letters of guarantee shall be assessed based on their value, unless the dispute is limited to a part thereof, in which case it shall be assessed according to that part.

## Article Three
The Prime Minister and the Ministers, each within his own jurisdiction, shall implement this Decree-Law. It shall be published in the Official Gazette and shall come into force from the date of its publication.

For all these considerations, and as the Amiri Order <orig>الأمر الأميري</orig> was issued on 10/5/2024, Article (4) of which stipulates that laws shall be issued by decrees-by-law, the present draft decree-by-law has been prepared. Its first article provides for the replacement of a number of articles of the aforementioned Law No. 17 of 1973. The texts of Articles (2) and (8), first paragraph, were replaced by adding the phrase "(principal or principal and alternative)," in the context of specifying multiple claims, to make it clearer as dictated by good drafting, and as it is known that a plaintiff may have principal and alternative claims.
It was deemed appropriate to replace the text of Article (5), rephrasing and rearranging its clauses in light of the deletion of the phrase "opposition by a non-bankrupt party to the declaration of bankruptcy and all subsidiary claims related to the bankruptcy," which was in clause (d). This is because the Executive Regulations <orig>اللائحة التنفيذية</orig> of the Bankruptcy Law <orig>قانون الإفلاس</orig> issued by Law No. (71) of 2020 addressed the amount of judicial fees <orig>الرسوم القضائية</orig> due for all lawsuits, applications, grievances, and appeals related to bankruptcy, which necessitated the deletion of that phrase in this draft. It was also deemed appropriate to add the phrase "applications and orders on petitions <orig>الطلبات والأوامر على عرائض</orig> submitted to the Execution Department <orig>إدارة التنفيذ</orig> and grievances against them" to clause (g), considering that these applications are of unquantifiable value.
This draft has codified a considered and fair increase in judicial fees, replacing the text of Article (6) of the aforementioned Law No. 17 of 1973, with the aim of reassessing the proportional fees imposed on lawsuits of quantifiable value. It imposes fees as a percentage of the claim value, which are (5%) up to thirty thousand dinars <orig>دينار</orig>, 3.5% for amounts exceeding thirty thousand dinars <orig>دينار</orig> up to one hundred and fifty thousand dinars <orig>دينار</orig>, 2.5% for amounts exceeding one hundred and fifty thousand dinars <orig>دينار</orig> up to five hundred thousand dinars <orig>دينار</orig>, 1.5% for amounts exceeding five hundred thousand dinars <orig>دينار</orig> up to five million dinars <orig>دينار</orig>, and 1% for amounts exceeding five million dinars <orig>دينار</orig>). These brackets are calculated progressively, meaning the fees are not deducted from the total amount but are collected gradually according to the preceding brackets. The text also introduced a provision for a minimum prescribed fee of ten dinars <orig>دنانير</orig>.
The draft also replaced the text of Article (7), reassessing the fixed fee imposed on lawsuits of unquantifiable value. It imposes a fee of ten dinars <orig>دنانير</orig> for applications and orders on petitions <orig>الأوامر على عرائض</orig> submitted to the Execution Department <orig>إدارة التنفيذ</orig>; fifty dinars <orig>ديناراً</orig> for applications submitted to the judge of summary matters <orig>قاضي الأمور الوقتية</orig>, lawsuits filed with the judge of urgent matters <orig>قاضي الأمور المستعجلة</orig>, and applications in urgent matters submitted to the trial court ancillary to the substantive claims; one hundred dinars <orig>دينار</orig> for lawsuits filed initially before the Court of First Instance (Partial Circuit) <orig>المحكمة الجزئية</orig>, the Court of First Instance (Plenary Circuit) <orig>الكلية</orig>, the Court of Appeal <orig>محكمة الاستئناف</orig>, or the Court of Cassation <orig>محكمة التمييز</orig>; one hundred and fifty dinars <orig>ديناراً</orig> for lawsuits concerning temporary execution disputes <orig>إشكالات التنفيذ الوقتية</orig> before the judge of urgent matters; three hundred dinars <orig>دينار</orig> for requests for the recusal of a judge, expert, or arbitrator, emphasizing that the prescribed fee is multiplied by the number of individuals whose recusal is sought; and five hundred dinars <orig>دينار</orig> for requests to refer real estate to the sales judge <orig>قاضي البيوع</orig> in preparation for its sale by auction.
The draft then replaced the text of Article (9), limiting its provision to imposing a fixed fee on personal status lawsuits <orig>الدعاوى المتعلقة بالأحوال الشخصية</orig> of all types, partnership partition lawsuits, and grievances against orders on petitions <orig>الأوامر على عرائض</orig>, including grievances against the list of fees, expenses, and costs. The draft also replaced the text of Article (10), introducing a new provision to collect fees on those lawsuits that have been struck out for one year without being renewed, or for which the period of punitive or consensual stay <orig>الوقف الجزائي أو الاتفاقي</orig> has expired without proceedings being resumed. This is because practical experience has shown that some plaintiffs—who have obtained a decision from the exemption committee for a temporary waiver of judicial fees—file their lawsuits and then deliberately fail to appear during the proceedings, leading the court to issue a decision to strike out the case. This is done either because they anticipate losing their case and wish to avoid a judgment dismissing their claim and ordering them to pay costs, or because they have settled with the defendants outside the courtroom. Consequently, the lawsuits remain struck out for a full year. Since no final, conclusive judgment resolving the dispute has been issued in these cases, this poses an obstacle for the judicial fees administration in collecting fees from those liable to pay them. The same applies to lawsuits in which a judgment of punitive or consensual stay was issued and a year has passed without proceedings being resumed. Furthermore, to regulate the stability of litigation procedures, ensure they are not perpetuated, and encourage the plaintiff to pursue their lawsuit, the same text imposes a fixed fee of five dinars <orig>دنانير</orig> on requests to renew lawsuits that have been struck out, to shorten their hearing dates, or to expedite them after a punitive or consensual stay, with the applicant being liable for this fee.

The draft reorganized the procedures and conditions for exemption from judicial fees in a manner that guarantees a litigant whose inability is proven is exempted from paying the prescribed judicial fees, and to limit, as much as possible, the phenomenon of unwarranted resort to exemption requests. It was decided to replace the text of Article (15) to stipulate that an exemption request submitted to the Clerks' Department <orig>إدارة الكتاب</orig> at the Court of First Instance <orig>المحكمة الكلية</orig> must be accompanied by all supporting documents or copies thereof. The Clerks' Department must notify the Judicial Fees Department <orig>إدارة الرسوم القضائية</orig> of the applicant and their documents, so that it may submit its report on each request. It was also decided that the text should include a new composition for the Exemption Committee <orig>لجنة الإعفاء</orig>, which is now formed of three judges—in contrast to the current text where the committee was formed of one judge and a member of the Public Prosecution <orig>نيابة عامة</orig>. This change is due to the fact that practical experience has shown the limited role of the Public Prosecution member in this exemption process. Furthermore, forming the committee of three judges would reduce the likelihood of error in their decision and ensure a swift resolution, especially since this is generally done in the absence of the litigants and without a hearing—unless the committee deems their presence necessary. It issues its decision by a majority vote of its members, including its reasoning when granting the exemption request, and stating the grounds on which the state of inability was established.
The draft included a replacement for the text of Article (16), whereby the Judicial Fees Department <orig>إدارة الرسوم القضائية</orig> now has the right to directly request the aforementioned committee to annul the exemption decision. It also became mandatory for the Clerks' Department of the Court of First Instance <orig>إدارة كتاب المحكمة الكلية</orig> to notify the circuit still hearing the case of the annulment decision issued by the committee. The draft also replaced the text of Article (17) in a manner consistent with the text of the preceding article.
The draft proposed raising the judicial fees for notices, announcements, requests for copies of judgments by non-litigants, and other documents specified in the texts of Articles (18, first paragraph) and (19) of the law, to ensure the optimal use of the judicial service provided to the applicant.
Since a judgment deeming a lawsuit null and void is a judgment that terminates the litigation and nullifies all its effects, and does not rule on the right claimed in the lawsuit should the plaintiff wish to refile it, it was decided to replace the text of Article (22) so that a judgment deeming the lawsuit null and void becomes the inevitable consequence of the plaintiff's failure to pay the prescribed fee for their motions after the expiration of the appropriate period granted by the court, provided the non-payment was without an acceptable excuse. This consequence, once its conditions are met, must be applied by the court on its own initiative and without need for a plea. The reason for this new provision is what practical experience has revealed: plaintiffs' casual refusal to pay the fees due on their motions during the hearing of the case, and the reluctance of some judicial circuits to decide to dismiss the lawsuit or motion for which the fee was not paid as stipulated in the current text, which resulted in the loss of the opportunity to collect these fees for the Public Treasury <orig>الخزانة العامة</orig> promptly.
As Law No. 17 of 1973, aforementioned, was promulgated before the Civil and Commercial Procedures Law issued by Decree-Law No. 38 of 1980, aforementioned, it was therefore decided to replace the text of Article (23) of the Judicial Fees Law in a way that aligns with the rules contained in Article (123) of the Civil and Commercial Procedures Law concerning the assessment of fee orders and grievances against them. The draft also introduced a second paragraph to that article, which states that without prejudice to the rules for exemption from judicial fees, the applicant "the plaintiff" is obligated to pay the fee until it is finally ruled to be borne by the other party. The justification for this new provision is that the legislator intended for the submission of the statement of claim or the incidental motion to the court to be the event that creates the right to collect the judicial fees due to the Public Treasury <orig>الخزانة العامة</orig> for it. And that the plaintiff is obligated to pay the fee due on the lawsuit they file or the motion they submit once the lawsuit or motion is legally brought before the court. Thus, the Judicial Fees Department <orig>إدارة الرسوم القضائية</orig> has the right to demand from the plaintiff the fees due on the lawsuit they file or the motion they submit, while it does not have the right to demand it from the defendant except when the latter is finally ordered to pay the litigation costs, which is precisely what the rulings of the Court of Cassation <orig>محكمة التمييز</orig> have established.
Article Two of the present draft stipulated the addition of clauses (f) and (g) to the text of Article (4) of the aforementioned Law No. 17 of 1973, to specify the judicial fees due on certain lawsuits of known value that were not provided for in the existing law. These are lawsuits for the annulment of judgments by courts, judicial bodies, and arbitrators, where the fee is assessed based on the value awarded in the judgment, as well as motions related to letters of guarantee, where the fee is assessed based on their value, unless the dispute is limited to a part thereof, in which case it is assessed according to that part. The draft intentionally used the phrase "judicial bodies <orig>الجهات القضائية</orig>" in the said text to accommodate the establishment of any judicial body, whether composed of judicial elements or a mix of judicial and non-judicial elements, to adjudicate specific disputes. This is inferred from the text of Articles (95) and (173) of the Constitution, where the constitutional legislator used the phrase "judicial body <orig>جهة قضائية</orig>".
Article Three of the present draft obligates the Prime Minister <orig>رئيس مجلس الوزراء</orig>, and the Ministers, each within their respective jurisdictions, to implement this Decree-Law, and it shall be published in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>.

This shall be upon the request of a foreign judicial authority in accordance with the agreed-upon conditions, provided that such action would lead to identifying their destination or apprehending the perpetrators.

### Part Three: Transfer of Sentenced Persons

## Article (24)

4- The sentenced person must hold the nationality of the State of enforcement at the time the request is submitted.
5- The sentenced person must consent to the execution of their transfer request.
6- The conviction judgment must not have been issued for a crime involving public funds, a breach of military duties, or other crimes that would prejudice the sovereignty and security of the State or its public order. However, as an exception, the sentenced person may be transferred in cases of crimes involving public funds if they have paid the amounts of restitution and the fine imposed.
7- The sentence imposed on the sentenced person must not be the death penalty.

## Article (25)
The Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> may refuse to execute a request for the transfer of a sentenced person in the following cases:
1- If the acts for which the conviction judgment was issued are the subject of criminal proceedings being conducted by the judicial authority or competent bodies in the State.
2- If the execution of the request to transfer the sentenced person would prejudice the sovereignty of the State, its national security, or its public order.
3- If the sentenced person has not paid the fines and compensation awarded against them, and any other financial obligations that are due.
4- If the sentenced person is accused in other cases that have not been finally adjudicated, or has been sentenced to imprisonment in cases other than the one subject to the transfer request, and the sentence has not been executed.
5- If the sentenced person held the nationality of the State at the time of the commission of the crime for which the conviction judgment was issued.

## Article (26)

# Article (41)

A request for judicial assistance for the recovery of the proceeds of a crime or their equivalent value must be accompanied by the confiscation judgment issued in the requesting State, and this judgment must be final and not subject to appeal.

The confiscation judgment may be non-conviction-based if the domestic laws of the requesting State so provide.

Requests for judicial assistance for the enforcement of foreign judicial confiscation orders or judgments are not directly enforceable, and the Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> must conduct the necessary investigations to file a confiscation lawsuit before the Criminal Court <orig>محكمة الجنايات</orig>.

The Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> shall initiate the confiscation lawsuit against the owner and possessor of the funds by means of a statement of claim filed with the court, which shall include the following information:

1- Information identifying the owner and possessor of the funds.
2- A statement of the funds for which confiscation is sought.
3- A description of the crime that is the subject of the lawsuit, with the applicable legal provisions.
4- The legal basis for the request for judicial assistance.
5- A statement of the evidence of the commission of the crime and its connection to the funds sought for confiscation.
6- A copy of the final, non-appealable confiscation judgment.

The lawsuit shall be filed in accordance with the procedures prescribed for filing a criminal case in felony matters as stipulated in the aforementioned Code of Criminal Procedure and Trials <orig>قانون الإجراءات والمحاكمات الجزائية</orig>, and the procedures, rules, and guarantees stipulated therein shall apply to all its stages, in a manner that does not conflict with the provisions of this Decree-Law <orig>مرسوم بقانون</orig>, and the court shall decide the case expeditiously.

All of this is without prejudice to the right of the requesting State or third parties to pursue the direct recovery of funds, property, or assets by filing a civil lawsuit on their own behalf before the competent courts in the State.

In all cases, the aforementioned funds may not be confiscated if their owner or possessor proves good faith, and that they were obtained in exchange for providing services commensurate with their value or for other legitimate reasons, and that they were unaware of their source.

# Article (42)

The judgment issued in the confiscation lawsuit shall be served on the convicted party in accordance with the cases and procedures specified for the extradition lawsuit as stipulated in Article (13) of this Decree-Law <orig>مرسوم بقانون</orig>.

The Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> or the convicted party may appeal this judgment before the Court of Appeal <orig>محكمة الاستئناف</orig> within (30) days, and this period shall commence in accordance with the rules and procedures stipulated in the aforementioned Article (13).

The judgment issued by the court shall be appealable before the Court of Cassation <orig>محكمة التمييز</orig> under the same rules and procedures prescribed for appealing criminal judgments.

In all cases, the judgment issued in this lawsuit may not be challenged by way of opposition <orig>المعارضة</orig>.

All judgments issued in confiscation lawsuits shall be published in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>.

# Article (43)

Any interested party, even if not a party to the confiscation lawsuit, may object to the judgment issued therein if their objection is based on their ownership of the funds prior to the confiscation, without knowledge of their illicit source.

The objection shall be filed with the court that issued the judgment within (30) days from the date of the judgment's publication in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>, by registering it with the clerk's office of that court <orig>إدارة كتاب هذه المحكمة</orig>. The objection must include a statement of the judgment being objected to and the grounds for the objection, otherwise it shall be void, and the court shall decide on it expeditiously.

The court hearing the objection may be composed of the same judges who issued the judgment.

The objection shall not suspend the execution of the judgment unless the court so orders. The acceptance of the objection shall result in a retrial of the case before the court that issued the judgment, limited to the part being objected to, without affecting the other convicted parties or the remaining confiscated funds.

The court may not annul or amend the judgment except to the extent required by the objection and the parts prejudicial to the objector, and only the person who filed the objection shall benefit from the judgment issued thereon.

As an exception to the preceding provisions, the objection shall be submitted to the court hearing the case if it has not yet been decided.

# Article (44)

The confiscation judgment may not be executed until it becomes final and (30) days have passed since its publication in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>. The Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> shall carry out the execution procedures in coordination with the competent authorities.

In the event of a judgment rejecting the confiscation, the Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> shall issue an order to lift all precautionary measures <orig>الإجراءات التحفظية</orig> imposed on the funds subject to the confiscation lawsuit, unless the funds are under investigation in the State.

# Article (45)

The Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> may refuse a request for judicial assistance in the following cases:

1- If the execution of the request would prejudice the sovereignty of the State, harm its security, public order <orig>نظامها العام</orig>, or other essential public interests.
2- If the act on which the request is based does not constitute a crime within the State.
3- If the execution of the request conflicts with the laws of the State.
4- If the request relates to a crime for which the accused has been finally acquitted, has been granted a pardon, or for which the lawsuit is time-barred or the penalty has lapsed.
5- If there are substantial grounds to believe that the request for assistance was made for the purpose of prosecuting a person on account of their gender, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, or political opinions.

## Explanatory Memorandum for Decree-Law No. 79 of 2025 concerning International Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters

Whereas the effectiveness of cooperation and information exchange are crucial elements for success in confronting transnational crimes and in recovering funds and assets, as requests for international judicial cooperation in criminal matters are the cornerstone of international efforts to combat organized criminal behavior.
Mutual judicial assistance in the context of criminal matters is a procedural process by which states request and provide assistance with all evidentiary evidence for use in criminal cases. As for the extradition of criminals, it is the formal procedural process by which one state requests the enforced return of a person accused or convicted of a crime to be tried or to serve a sentence imposed upon them in the requesting state.

Whereas practical reality has revealed certain operational difficulties created by the absence of legislative texts regulating international judicial cooperation in criminal matters in all its forms, in addition to the State of Kuwait being party to a large and diverse set of international, regional, and bilateral agreements whose provisions relate to the scope of mutual legal assistance, extradition of criminals, and transfer of sentenced persons; and whereas the Amiri Order was issued on 10/5/2024, Article (4) of which stipulates that laws shall be issued by decrees-by-law, therefore, the present draft decree-by-law has been prepared with the aim of regulating international judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
The provisions of this draft are set out in (52) articles divided into five chapters. Chapter One, in Articles (1 and 2), addresses definitions and general provisions, assigning the jurisdiction to receive and execute requests for legal assistance and extradition exclusively to the Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> in its capacity as the central authority for receiving such requests.
Chapter Two contains the provisions for the surrender of persons and objects in Articles (3 to 23), divided into three sections: the first titled (Surrender of Persons), the second titled (Extradition of Persons), and the third section dedicated to regulating cases of surrender and recovery of objects.
Chapter Three is titled Transfer of Sentenced Persons and includes Articles (24, 25, and 26), which stipulate the procedures for transferring sentenced persons to complete the execution of their sentences.
Chapter Four, in Articles (27 to 50), regulates the provisions related to various requests for legal assistance, their conditions, controls, and implementation mechanisms. This chapter is divided into four sections: the first is titled (Requests for Legal Assistance Received by the State) and includes Articles (27 to 45); the second is titled (Requests for Legal Assistance Issued to a Foreign State) and consists of three articles (46, 47, and 48); the third contains a single article, number (49), titled (Joint Investigations); and the fourth section, titled (Service and Notification of Judicial Documents and Papers in Other States), includes a single article, which is Article (50).
Finally, Chapter Five is titled Final Provisions and includes Article (51), and Article (52), which obliges the ministers, each within their respective jurisdictions, to implement the provisions of this decree-by-law, and specifies its effective date as the date of its publication in the Official Gazette.

# Article Seven
## Business Profits

1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other Contracting State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this Article, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.

3. Where a Contracting State, in accordance with paragraph (2) of this Article, makes an adjustment to the profits that are attributable to a permanent establishment of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and taxes accordingly profits of the enterprise which have been charged to tax in the other State, the other State shall, to the extent necessary to eliminate double taxation on these profits, make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged on those profits. In determining such adjustment, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.

4. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as a deduction expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the business of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses, whether incurred in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. However, no such deduction shall be allowed in respect of any amount, if any, relating to any nominal payment (other than for the reimbursement of actual expenses) made by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices in the form of nominal payments for the use of intellectual property, or by way of

Similarly, in determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be no deduction for amounts (other than for the reimbursement of actual expenses) charged by that permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, fees, or other similar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission for specific services performed or for management, or (except in the case of a banking enterprise) by way of income from debt-claims on the funds lent to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices.

h. Nothing in this Article shall prevent either of the Contracting States from imposing taxes on income or profits from any form of insurance or reinsurance activities in accordance with its regulations.

w. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.

z. If it is customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph (2) of this Article shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.

## Article Eight

# Article Ten
## Dividends

1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State.

2.

This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.

3. The term "dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares, mining shares, founders' shares, or other rights – not being debt-claims – participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.

4. The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case, the provisions of Article (Seven) or Article (Fifteen) of this Agreement, as the case may be, shall apply.

5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.

The competent authorities of the two Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their administrative subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles (First) and (Second) of this Agreement.

2. Any information received by a Contracting State under paragraph (1) of this Article shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph (1) of this Article. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when the laws of both Contracting States permit its use for such purposes and the competent authority of the supplying State has authorized such use.

3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:
a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State.
b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State.

d. If a Contracting State requests information in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph (3) of this Article but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.

e.

## Members of Diplomatic Missions and Consular Posts

Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts or employees of international organizations under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.

## Explanatory Memorandum
Of Decree-Law No. 81 of 2025
Approving the Agreement between the Government of the State of Kuwait and the Arab Organization for Agricultural Development
Concerning the Establishment of a Headquarters for the Organization in the Arabian Peninsula Region

Stemming from the League of Arab States <orig>جامعة الدول العربية</orig> Resolution No. (2635), issued during the 53rd session of the League Council on 11/03/1970, which includes in its membership the Arab member states of the League of Arab States and is headquartered in Khartoum, and as this organization is concerned with issues of agricultural and fisheries development, food security, and combating poverty in Arab countries.

And whereas the Government of the State of Kuwait <orig>حكومة دولة الكويت</orig>, represented by the Public Authority for Agriculture Affairs and Fish Resources <orig>الهيئة العامة لشؤون الزراعة والثروة السمكية</orig>, offered to host the headquarters of the Organization's regional office for the Arabian Peninsula region on 13/02/2012,

And whereas the Organization accepted this offer pursuant to the Organization's Assembly Resolution No. (20/32/J/A/2012), the Government of the State of Kuwait and the Arab Organization for Agricultural Development <orig>المنظمة العربية للتنمية الزراعية</orig> have agreed upon an agreement comprising (10) articles as follows:

Articles (1, 2) stipulated the terminology and legal personality of the office, and Article (3) clarified the purpose of this Agreement, which is to define the tasks undertaken by the office through the privileges and immunities granted to it.

Article (4) stipulated the facilities provided by the State of Kuwait, Article (5) referred to the immunity of the office, Article (6) outlined communication facilities, Article (7) included the immunities and privileges of the office members, Articles (8, 9) referred to the application and interpretation of the Agreement and the settlement of disputes, and Article (10) stipulated the entry into force, amendment, and termination of the Agreement.

As this Agreement serves the interest of the State of Kuwait and does not conflict with its commitments in the Arab and international spheres.

And whereas it is considered one of the agreements whose ratification, according to its provisions, requires a law in accordance with the text of the second paragraph of Article (70) of the Constitution, and as the Amiri Order <orig>الأمر الأميري</orig> was issued on 10/05/2024, and Article (4) thereof stipulated that laws shall be issued by decrees, therefore, the accompanying draft Decree-Law has been prepared for its approval.
