The debtor shall preside over the meeting, and with the approval of the required majority, a person from among the creditors or others may be chosen to preside over the meeting...". "The preventive settlement proposal shall be deemed to have met the creditors' approval if the required majority approves it. If the proposal does not obtain the approval of this majority in the first creditors' meeting, the meeting shall be postponed for a period of ten days for a second meeting to be held to vote on the proposal...". "With the exception of the provisions contained in this section, the provisions contained in the chapter on preventive settlement shall apply to the approval of the restructuring plan, to the grievance against this approval, to the ratification of the plan and the effect of this ratification, as well as to the implementation of the plan and the termination of its procedures before its implementation". "The debtor must invite the creditors to approve the restructuring plan by means of a notice that includes the time and place of the meeting, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the restructuring plan, provided that the meeting is held no later than one month from the date of notifying the representative of the creditors' committee and the committee members of the plan and its attachments. The debtor shall also send the invitation within the period specified in the preceding paragraph, by notifying the debtor and all creditors of the notice referred to in the preceding paragraph and its attachments...". "The trustee shall supervise the implementation of the restructuring plan for the duration of the plan and until its implementation is completed...". "The trustee shall be committed to the following: 1- Monitoring the progress of the plan and notifying the Bankruptcy Administration <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> and the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة الإفلاس</orig>—as the case may be—of any failure to implement it. 2- Ensuring that the sale of any of the debtor's assets decided to be sold in accordance with the restructuring plan is carried out at the best price obtainable under the prevailing market conditions on the date of sale, and that the sale proceeds are used as set forth in the plan. 3- Submitting a report on the progress of the plan's implementation to the Bankruptcy Administration <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> and the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة الإفلاس</orig>—as the case may be—every three months, and every creditor has the right to obtain a copy of this report."

## Therefore, we have decided the following:
First: The restructuring plan proposed by the applicant is hereby ratified.
Second: The restructuring trustee shall supervise the implementation of the restructuring plan in accordance with the mechanism and period agreed upon in the plan, provided that he submits a report to the Bankruptcy Administration <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> on the progress of the plan's implementation every three months. The Bankruptcy Administration <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> shall notify the applicant, the creditors, the trustee, and the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة الإفلاس</orig> of this decision in accordance with Article (55) of Bankruptcy Law No. 71/2020, publish it in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>, and register it in the Commercial Register of the debtor company.

There is a violation, which is an illegal construction on the ground floor with an area of 24 m2.

The remaining litigants or their legal representatives failed to appear despite being properly notified, and the aforementioned appraisal expert also failed to attend.
Whereupon we decided to complete the inspection, ascertain the private and public descriptions and specifications of the disputed property, and then estimate the value of the disputed property by another appraisal expert, other than the previous one, appointed due to his failure to execute the expert request by attending the inspection. Accordingly, the inspection was carried out as follows:–
The disputed property is a government housing unit located in the Al-Sabahiya <orig>الصباحية</orig> area, Block 1, Street 4, Plot 603 (front and back), overlooking an alley and a corner.

The first floor consists of 4 bedrooms, a hall, two bathrooms, and a kitchenette.
The roof floor consists of one bedroom for servants with its own attached bathroom. It also houses the property's services (water tank and air conditioning units).

## Second: Auction Conditions:
First: The auction shall begin at the base price indicated for the property. To participate in the auction, a payment of at least one-fifth of that price is required by a certified check from the drawee bank or by a letter of guarantee from a bank in favor of the Enforcement Directorate at the Ministry of Justice <orig>وزارة العدل</orig>.
Second: The person whose bid is approved by the judge must deposit, during the sale session, the full approved price, expenses, and registration fees.
Third: If the person whose bid was approved does not deposit the full price, they must deposit at least one-fifth of the price; otherwise, the bidding will be reopened at their liability in the same session, based on the price at which the sale was awarded.
Fourth: If the bidder deposits the price in the following session, the auction will be awarded to them, unless someone comes forward in that session who agrees to purchase with a ten percent increase, accompanied by a deposit of the full auction price. In this case, the bidding is reopened in the same session based on this new price.
Fifth: If the first bidder does not deposit the full price in the following session and no one comes forward with a ten percent increase, the bidding shall be immediately reopened at their liability based on the price that was awarded to them in the previous session. In this session, no bid will be considered unless it is accompanied by a deposit of its full value. The defaulting bidder shall be liable for any shortfall in the property's price.

** The property description certificate states that the property is a private residence consisting of a basement + ground floor + first floor + roof. The property does not conform to the licensed plans, as there is an additional structure on the roof which violates the building rules and regulations of the Kuwait Municipality <orig>بلدية الكويت</orig>.
** According to the expert's report:
The disputed property is located in the Al-Yarmouk <orig>اليرموك</orig> area – Block 1 – Street 1 – Avenue 3 – Plot 474 – Automated Address No. 15153149, in the presence and under the guidance of the defendant's agent, the plaintiff's agent, and the technical expert, Mr. Mohammed Al-Gharibah <orig>محمد الغريبة</orig>.
The expert matched the ownership documents of the disputed property with the actual site and found a discrepancy between the plot number mentioned in Document No. 2017/4482 and the address indicated by the plaintiff's agent. The plaintiff's agent stated that the reason for this is that Plot 474 resulted from the subdivision of Plot No. 339, according to the notes on the map issued by the Survey Department <orig>إدارة المساحة</orig> of the Kuwait Municipality <orig>بلدية الكويت</orig>, submitted within the plaintiff's portfolio of documents at the session of 9/9/2024.
The expert found that the disputed property overlooks the intersection of Riyadh Street <orig>شارع الرياض</orig> and the Fourth Ring Road <orig>الدائري الرابع</orig> from the east and northeast, and overlooks Avenue No. 3 from the southwest. It is bordered by neighbors on the south and northwest sides, and is clad in stone.
The defendant's agent allowed the expert to enter and inspect the property, where it was found to be a detached house for private residence that does not generate any revenue, with the following details:
1. Lower Level at the level of Avenue No. 3: Consists of two parts. The first includes a foyer + reception room + preparatory kitchen + laundry room + storage room + maid's room with its bathroom. The second part includes parking spaces + 6 maids' rooms with their bathrooms + a preparatory kitchen + an electricity room + a sitting room.
2. Ground Floor at the level of Riyadh Street <orig>شارع الرياض</orig>: Main foyer + 3 halls + dining room + main kitchen + preparatory kitchen + room/entrance + bathroom and washbasins.
3. First Floor: 3 bedrooms, each with a bathroom + preparatory kitchen + dining room + living room + large master bedroom suite with a dressing room, bathroom, and washbasins (the suite is under renovation) + balcony.
4. Second Floor: 3 bedrooms, each with a bathroom + laundry room + rooms for air conditioning and elevator services.
5. Roof: Air conditioning services.
6. Also on the ground floor at the level of Riyadh Street <orig>شارع الرياض</orig> is an aluminum tent that includes a large diwaniya <orig>ديوانية</orig> hall + bathroom and washbasins + a gym room + a small diwaniya <orig>ديوانية</orig> hall + a preparatory kitchen.
7. The house's finishes are as follows: Marble floors + wooden doors + pendant and spotlight lighting + central air conditioning + it includes one elevator serving 3 floors from the lower level to the first floor.
The technical expert inspected the property and reviewed the ownership/sale contract document No. 4482, which specified the property area as 2,535 m², in preparation for estimating the value of the buildings and the land to arrive at the total value of the property.

## Second: Auction Conditions:

First: The auction shall begin at the base price indicated for the property. Participation in the auction requires payment of at least one-fifth of that price by a check certified by the drawee bank or by a letter of guarantee from a bank in favor of the Execution Department at the Ministry of Justice <orig>إدارة التنفيذ بوزارة العدل</orig>.
