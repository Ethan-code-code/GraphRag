These provisions must be followed if the right holder is a creditor with a commercial paper and their recourse is limited to the drawer, the maker, the acceptor, or the guarantor of one of them. However, if they wish to seek recourse against others, they must follow the general rules for filing a lawsuit.

### Article (167):
#### First Paragraph:
The creditor must first serve the debtor with a notice to pay within a period of at least ten days, and then obtain a payment order from the judge of the Court of Minor Civil Matters or the head of the circuit at the Court of First Instance, as the case may be. The right stated in the notice to pay may not be less than that requested in the petition to obtain the payment order. It is sufficient for the notice to pay to be served by registered mail, or by any modern electronic means of communication that can be saved and retrieved, for which a decision is issued by the Minister of Justice.

#### Second Paragraph:
The payment order shall be issued based on a petition submitted by the creditor, to which the debt instrument and proof of service of the notice to pay are attached, and the closing of the account in cases where it is required. This instrument shall remain with the court clerk's office until the period for grievance has passed. The petition must be drawn up in two identical copies and must include the particulars of the statement of claim as stipulated in Article 45 of this law.

#### Third Paragraph:
The order must be issued on one of the two copies of the petition within a maximum of three days from its submission and must state the amount to be paid, as well as whether it is issued in a commercial matter.

### Article (169):
The debtor shall be served in person at their original domicile or place of work with the petition and the payment order issued against them. They may be served with both by e-mail or by any modern electronic means of communication that can be saved and retrieved, for which a decision is issued by the Minister of Justice.
The petition and the payment order issued thereon shall be considered null and void if they are not served on the debtor within six months from the date the order was issued.

### Article (170):
The debtor may file a grievance against the order within ten days from the date of its service. The grievance shall be filed before the Court of Minor Civil Matters or the Court of First Instance, as the case may be, and it must be reasoned, otherwise it shall be void. The rules and procedures followed before the court of first instance shall be observed when considering the grievance.
The acceptance of the grievance in form shall entail the examination of the formal and substantive conditions for issuing the order, and a ruling on the substance of the dispute, unless there is a defect in the petition and the order related to a violation of the rules of jurisdiction.
At the request of the grievant, the ruling may be limited to considering the payment order null and void, with another session set to hear the substance of the case. The payment order may not be appealed.
The judgment issued on the grievance may be appealed, when it is subject to appeal, in accordance with the rules and procedures prescribed for the appeal of judgments.

### Article Two
The Prime Minister and the Ministers – each within their respective jurisdictions – shall implement this Decree-Law. It shall be published in the Official Gazette and shall come into force from the date of its publication.

Whereas the regulation of the payment order <orig>أمر الأداء</orig> in the Civil and Commercial Procedure Law <orig>قانون المرافعات المدنية والتجارية</orig> issued by Decree-Law No. (38) of 1980 passed through two stages: initially, it was an optional path for the creditor to pursue a judicial claim through summary procedures. Then, for the sake of procedural economy, it was deemed necessary to make it a mandatory path by virtue of the amendment made to the aforementioned Civil and Commercial Procedure Law <orig>قانون المرافعات المدنية والتجارية</orig> under Decree-Law No. (44) of 1989, and the resulting effects, most notably the nullity of any violation thereof on the grounds that it pertains to the regulation of litigation procedures related to public order <orig>النظام العام</orig>. However, practical reality has shown that this regulation involves such hardship and complexity as to require reconsideration.
For all the foregoing, and whereas the Amiri Order <orig>الأمر الأميري</orig> was issued on 10/5/2024, and Article (4) thereof stipulated that laws shall be issued by decree-laws <orig>مراسيم بقوانين</orig>, the present draft decree-law has been prepared. Its first article provides for amending the final jurisdictional limit of the Partial Court <orig>النصاب الانتهائي للمحكمة الجزئية</orig> and raising it from one thousand dinars to two thousand dinars by replacing the phrase "one thousand dinars <orig>ألف دينار</orig>" with the phrase "two thousand dinars <orig>ألفين دينار</orig>" at the end of Article (29) of the aforementioned Civil and Commercial Procedure Law <orig>قانون المرافعات المدنية والتجارية</orig>.
The first article of the draft also stipulated the replacement of the texts of Articles (166), (167, first, second, and third paragraphs), (169), and (170) of the aforementioned Civil and Commercial Procedure Law <orig>قانون المرافعات المدنية والتجارية</orig>. Under the amendment made to the text of Article (166) of the Procedure Law, the payment order <orig>أمر الأداء</orig> path has become optional <orig>جوازي</orig>, and it may also be conducted electronically in accordance with the regulations to be issued by a decision of the Minister of Justice <orig>وزير العدل</orig>. The payment order <orig>أمر الأداء</orig> is now limited to monetary debts <orig>الديون النقدية</orig>, even if legal interest <orig>فوائدها القانونية</orig> is claimed with them, so that the dispute is not lost, considering the established judicial precedent that a claim for late payment interest <orig>فوائد التأخيرية</orig> is not pursued through a payment order <orig>أمر الأداء</orig>, while excluding claims for movable property of a specific quantity <orig>المنقولات معينة المقدار</orig>, due to the rarity of such claims in practice, as well as the varying assessments of what is considered specifically identified in a manner that negates ambiguity. According to the amendment made to the second paragraph of this article, the payment order <orig>أمر الأداء</orig> path has become mandatory only for commercial papers <orig>الأوراق التجارية</orig>. Accordingly, it is now permissible to claim fees and consideration for public services <orig>الرسوم ومقابل الخدمات العامة</orig> through an initial lawsuit <orig>بدعوى مبتدأة</orig>.
In view of the adoption of modern methods for the service of judicial papers <orig>إعلان الأوراق القضائية</orig>—under the amendment made to the Civil and Commercial Procedure Law <orig>قانون المرافعات المدنية والتجارية</orig> by Law No. 9 of 2020—the first paragraph of Article (167) of the aforementioned Civil and Commercial Procedure Law <orig>قانون المرافعات المدنية والتجارية</orig> has been replaced. It now provides that the creditor may serve notice on the debtor by any modern electronic means of communication that can be saved and retrieved, to be specified by a decision of the Minister of Justice <orig>وزير العدل</orig> (such as the Sahal application <orig>تطبيق سهل</orig>), or through the traditional method of registered mail <orig>البريد المسجل</orig>, taking into account the need to increase the period for the notice to pay <orig>التكليف بالوفاء</orig> from five days to ten days, given the change in circumstances and the increase in workload and burdens compared to when the original period was stipulated.
Also added to the text of the second paragraph of the aforementioned Article (167) is the case of "account closure <orig>قفل الحساب</orig>" to verify the application of the provision of Article (400) of the Commercial Law <orig>قانون التجارة</orig> issued by Decree-Law No. 68 of 1980, under which the debt becomes due upon account closure, in relation to claims that may be filed prematurely by some banking institutions and service companies.
The amendment to the text of the third paragraph of the same article included the cancellation of the provision related to movable property <orig>المنقولات</orig> for the sake of consistency with the amendment made to the aforementioned Article (166).
Article (169) of the aforementioned Civil and Commercial Procedure Law <orig>قانون المرافعات المدنية والتجارية</orig> was amended by adding the form of electronic service <orig>الإعلان الإلكتروني</orig> via email or any modern electronic means of communication that can be saved and retrieved, to be specified by a decision of the Minister of Justice <orig>وزير العدل</orig>. This is to resolve disputes and confirm the established judicial precedent in many of its rulings, which considers that service by this modern method has the same effect as personal service <orig>الإعلان الشخصي</orig> to the intended recipient.
Finally, the first article of the present draft provided for the replacement of Article (170) of the aforementioned Civil and Commercial Procedure Law <orig>قانون المرافعات المدنية والتجارية</orig>, while retaining its first paragraph, replacing its second paragraph, and adding three new paragraphs to it.
The text of the second paragraph of Article (170) affirmed the duty to address the merits of the dispute <orig>أصل النزاع</orig> to simplify procedures, with the exception of the defect of violating jurisdiction <orig>عيب مخالفة الاختصاص</orig>, as it removes the case from the subject-matter jurisdiction of the court, whether partial or plenary. The text of its third paragraph permitted the court, upon the request of the grievant <orig>المتظلم</orig>, to consider the grievance <orig>التظلم</orig> as if it were never filed and to set another session to hear the case, if the grievant has a vested interest in doing so, in order to halt the compulsory execution procedures <orig>إجراءات التنفيذ الجبري</orig> taken against them in commercial matters, or to prepare their evidence or formulate their defense.
The fourth paragraph of this article stipulated that the payment order <orig>أمر الأداء</orig> may not be appealed <orig>استئناف</orig>, while its final paragraph permitted an appeal of the judgment issued on the grievance <orig>الحكم الصادر في التظلم</orig>. This is to avoid practical problems that may arise when appealing the payment order <orig>أمر الأداء</orig> directly, while ensuring compliance with the established rules of the principle of two-tiered litigation <orig>مبدأ التقاضي على درجتين</orig>.
The second article of the present draft obligates the Prime Minister <orig>رئيس مجلس الوزراء</orig>, and the Ministers, each within their own jurisdiction, to implement this law, and specified its effective date as the date of its publication in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>.

# Explanatory Memorandum for Decree-Law No. 72 of 2025 Amending Certain Provisions of Decree-Law No. 46 of 1989 Concerning Small-Value Claims

More than thirty-five years have passed since the issuance of Decree-Law No. 46 of 1989 Concerning Small-Value Claims. At the time of its implementation, it included sufficient rules and provisions to simplify litigation procedures and achieve swift judgment, without prejudice to the fundamental principles and guarantees of justice, as a means of facilitating matters for litigants and judges as much as possible.
The provisions of this Decree-Law remain in force and have not been subject to repeal, abrogation, or amendment. However, a reluctance to resort to its application has been observed, despite judicial statistics indicating that claims valued at less than two thousand dinars constitute approximately (75%) of the total cases heard by the courts of first instance, on average, over the last five years.
For all the foregoing reasons, and given that some provisions of the aforementioned Decree-Law No. 46 of 1989 have become outdated, particularly Articles (1, 2, and 9) thereof, and taking into account the legislative developments that have accompanied the fundamental code of litigation represented by the Civil and Commercial Procedures Law promulgated by Decree-Law No. 38 of 1980 and the amendments made to it, especially after the adoption of modern methods for serving judicial papers and the amendment of the final jurisdictional threshold of the courts of first instance, raising it from one thousand dinars to two thousand dinars.
Whereas the Amiri Order was issued on 10/5/2024, and Article (4) thereof stipulated that laws shall be issued by decree-laws, the present draft Decree-Law was prepared. Its first article included the provision to raise the value threshold for the application of the aforementioned Decree-Law No. 46 of 1989, by replacing the phrase (one thousand dinars) with the phrase (two thousand dinars) in Article (1) thereof.
The first article of the present draft Decree-Law also stipulated the replacement of the text of Article (2) of the aforementioned Decree-Law No. 46 of 1989. It now mandates the Court Clerk's Department to notify the defendant of the date of the first session, whether this notification is in person, via email, or by any modern electronic means of communication that can be saved and retrieved, for which a decision is issued by the Minister of Justice. The notification, whether in person or by electronic means, shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions stipulated in the aforementioned Civil and Commercial Procedures Law, especially since many rulings of the Court of Cassation have adopted the view that electronic notification has the same meaning and effect as personal notification to the intended recipient.
The first article of the draft also replaced the text of Article (9) of the aforementioned Decree-Law No. 46 of 1989. Its first paragraph now stipulates that the default for small-value claims is the issuance of a summary judgment that includes a statement of the case facts, i.e., the procedures for filing it, the claims made, the sequence of sessions, and the substance of the defense, all of which should be in a concise statement for the sake of facilitation. It also emphasizes the recording of the legal and factual reasons for the judgment—that is, the legal grounds—on which the judgment relied in its application to the facts of the case, which should also be for summary reasons for the same purpose. It was deemed necessary to state this explicitly to prevent any ambiguity that arose during the application of the original text, which was satisfied with the issuance of a judgment containing summary reasons, as these reasons, in reality, do not differ from the meaning of the aforementioned legal and factual reasons.

The first paragraph of this article concluded by affirming the application of general rules in considering the judgment issued in small claims cases as enforceable by its nature, given that it is issued in a final capacity and is not subject to appeal, in accordance with the text of Article (192) of the aforementioned Civil and Commercial Procedures Law.
The second paragraph of the substituted Article (9) introduced a new provision aimed at simplifying the conditions set forth in the aforementioned Civil and Commercial Procedures Law, as stipulated in its Article (115), which do not require the reasoning of judgments when three conditions are met. These are: that the judgment is issued by the court of first instance granting all of the plaintiff's claims, after the defendant has been properly served, but has not appeared in the case nor submitted a defense memorandum. In fact, as it was conceivable that these conditions could also be met within the scope of small claims cases, and to resolve any potential dispute, the same provision was included in the second paragraph of Article (9) of the aforementioned Decree-Law No. 46 of 1989, while mitigating the severity of those conditions to suit the nature of small claims cases. This paragraph affirmed that there is no need to state the legal and factual reasons in the judgment when litigation in a small claims case is conducted without communication between the litigants, and it is evident that the plaintiff was justified in all of their claims.
The third paragraph of the aforementioned Article (9) affirmed that a ruling denying compensation for attorney's fees is not considered a rejection of some of the claims, so as not to defeat the purpose of providing this license.
The second article of the present bill obligates the Prime Minister <orig>رئيس مجلس الوزراء</orig>, and the ministers <orig>الوزراء</orig>, each within their respective jurisdictions, to implement this law, and it specifies that its effective date shall be from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>.

# Explanatory Memorandum
## To Decree-Law No. 73 of 2025 Amending Certain Provisions of Law No. 26 of 1961 Concerning the National Flag of the State of Kuwait
Due to the lack of regulation for raising the flags of foreign countries, certain acts related to the use of flags have been observed, including the raising of flags of some foreign countries in the country during official celebrations, which could disrupt public security. Additionally, some individuals have raised flags symbolizing religious groups or sects and emblems of some tribes during certain celebrations, which undermines the due respect for national belonging.
To preserve public security, protect society, consolidate the duty of belonging, and maintain national unity, this law has been introduced to regulate the raising of foreign flags and to prohibit the raising of flags and emblems that symbolize religious, social, or tribal groups or sects. The law consists of three articles: the first article stipulates the addition of a new article to the aforementioned Law No. 26/1961, numbered (Three bis); the second article provides for the amendment of Article Five; and the third is an executive article.
Article Three bis was introduced to prohibit the raising of foreign flags within the country, whether on ordinary days, public or private holidays and celebrations, or the national holidays of the foreign state, except after obtaining a license to do so from the Minister of Interior <orig>وزير الداخلية</orig>. Given that some international agreements stipulate the raising of flags and emblems of states on embassies, consulates, and diplomatic vehicles, the law explicitly states that this shall not prejudice international agreements and customs in this regard.
The article also prohibits the raising of flags and emblems that symbolize religious, social, or tribal groups or sects. This prohibition applies during ordinary days or during celebrations of certain occasions or elections. Excluded from this are the emblems and flags of sports clubs, as well as the flags of foreign countries during the period of regional or international sports tournaments held in the State of Kuwait <orig>دولة الكويت</orig>.
As for Article Five of the draft, it has established penalties for violating the provisions of Articles Two, Three, and Four of the law. It also renews the penalties for violating the acts listed exclusively in the law, and stiffens the penalty for violating the provisions of Article Three bis, as well as stiffening the penalty in the case of recidivism for the same act.

And whereas the Amiri Order dated 10/5/2024 was issued, stipulating in its Article (4) that laws shall be issued by decree-laws, the attached draft decree-law—consisting of three articles—has been prepared concerning the amendment of some provisions of Law No. (80) of 2015 on Family Foster Care.

The first article of the aforementioned draft law stipulated the replacement of Article (6/first paragraph) of the said law with the aim of adding a representative from both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs <orig>وزارة الخارجية</orig> and the Supreme Council for Family Affairs <orig>المجلس الأعلى لشئون الأسرة</orig> to the membership of the Family Foster Care Committee <orig>لجنة الحضانة العائلية</orig> to enhance the committee's role in continuously monitoring developments and challenges and making appropriate decisions. It also stipulated the replacement of Article (12) of the said law so that care, in all cases, for a daughter ends upon her reaching the age of thirty and securing continuous employment. It also stipulated the replacement of Article (13) of the same law so that the Family Foster Care Committee <orig>لجنة الحضانة العائلية</orig>—instead of the Minister—shall regulate private foster care for the category of children of unknown parents or of an unknown father and a known non-Kuwaiti mother. It also stipulated the replacement of Article (14) of the same law so that the homes and institutions under the competent department shall take all effective, necessary, and required administrative and organizational measures to enroll those in their care in compulsory education stages and to develop specialized programs to ensure their qualification for integration into society. It also stipulated the replacement of Article (15) of the same law so that the Family Foster Care Committee <orig>لجنة الحضانة العائلية</orig>—instead of the Minister—shall issue a decision regulating the conditions and controls of fostering. It also stipulated the replacement of Article (16) of the same law so that the Ministry, in coordination with the relevant authorities, whether governmental or private, shall seek to provide private housing for children who have reached the age of 21 to reside in, in exchange for a suitable monthly rent paid from their own funds, in accordance with a system to be issued by a decision of the Minister. And it stipulated the replacement of Article (17) of the same law so that the Ministry, in coordination with the competent authorities, shall seek to find employment opportunities for the children after the end of their care, according to their qualifications and experience, to ensure their residential and social independence.

The second article of the attached draft decree-law decided to add a new clause to Article (1) of the same law, which provides a definition for son / daughter / children.

Finally, the third article of the attached draft decree-law mandated that this law be implemented and effective from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette.

# Decree-Law No. 75 of 2025 concerning the Collection of Fees and Financial Costs Due for the Use of Public Utilities and Services

- Having reviewed the Constitution,
- And the Amiri Order issued on 2 Dhu al-Qi'dah 1445 H, corresponding to 10 May 2024 AD,
- And Decree-Law No. 67 of 1976 concerning Traffic, and its amending laws,
- And the Civil and Commercial Procedures Law issued by Decree-Law No. 38 of 1980, and its amending laws,

- And based on the proposal of the Minister of Finance,

## Article One

In the event that a debtor—whether a natural person or a person of private law—fails to pay any of the fees and financial costs for the use of public utilities and services provided by a state ministry, one of its public institutions or authorities, or any other government entity, the creditor entity must notify them to pay by any of the means of notification stipulated in the aforementioned Civil and Commercial Procedures Law.

If the debtor fails to pay within a period of thirty days from the date of notification, the creditor entity shall temporarily suspend its services to them.

This suspension shall be automatically lifted from the creditor entity's "automated system" as soon as the debtor pays these dues in full, and they must be provided with a clearance certificate if they request one.

However, the creditor entity may, upon the request of the debtor or their legal representative, issue a decision to grant an installment plan for the debt to a debtor who is unable to pay it in a single payment, in accordance with the controls and conditions specified by a decision from the representative of the creditor entity. The suspension shall be lifted by its decision if it approves the installment request.

In the event the debtor fails to pay any of the installments on their specified due dates, the creditor entity shall issue a decision to cancel the installment plan decision and proceed with enforcement procedures against the debtor to collect the debt or what remains of it.

And in an effort to regulate the relationship between the state's ministries, institutions, and public authorities that provide these services and their beneficiaries, a relationship that has reached a stage detrimental to public funds, as practical reality has revealed the existence of many beneficiaries who have chosen the path of procrastination and delay in paying these fees despite their financial ability to do so. It was therefore necessary to enact a new law that, on one hand, allows the state to use a means of pressure on this type of debtor to compel them to pay. As the Amiri Order was issued on 10/5/2024, and Article (4) thereof stipulated that laws shall be issued by decrees-by-law, the draft of the corresponding decree-by-law was prepared.

The first article thereof stipulates that creditor government entities must temporarily suspend their services to the debtor if they do not make payment after a period of thirty days from the date of their notification. To encourage and urge them to pay, this suspension of services is automatically lifted from the "automated system" in the devices of those entities as soon as they pay these dues in full.

As practical application has shown that some debtors have struggled to pay this debt and it has accumulated over years, making it impossible for them to pay it to the creditor entity in a single payment, it was deemed appropriate to stipulate in the last paragraph of the first article that the creditor entity may, upon the request of the debtor or their legal representative, issue a decision to allow the payment of the debt in installments for the debtor who is unable to pay it in a single installment, in accordance with the regulations and conditions to be determined by a decision from the representative of the creditor entity. The suspension shall be lifted by its decision if it approves the installment request. In the event the debtor fails to pay any of the installments on their specified dates, the creditor entity shall issue a decision to cancel the installment decision and proceed with enforcement procedures against the debtor to collect the debt or what remains of it. And as a grievance <orig>التظلم</orig> is a written means submitted by the concerned party to the administrative entity that issued the decision for its review, which may result in its modification or cancellation.

## Article Two

A lawsuit filed by the debtor concerning the decision of temporary suspension of public services or concerning a dispute over the basis or amount of the dues owed by them shall not be accepted before a written grievance <orig>التظلم</orig> is submitted to the creditor entity, in accordance with its established procedures. The grievance must be decided upon within thirty days from the date of its submission. The expiration of this period without a decision being issued on the grievance shall be considered a rejection thereof. The lawsuit must be filed within thirty days either from the date the debtor is notified of the rejection of their grievance by any of the means of notification stipulated in the aforementioned Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure, or from the date of the expiration of the period specified for deciding on their grievance, whichever is earlier.

## Article Three

The amounts due to any of the entities stipulated in the first article of this decree-by-law shall, by virtue of the provisions of this decree-by-law, have a lien over all the debtor's assets, whether movable or immovable.

## Article Four

The document evidencing the debt owed by the debtor, or the decision for its collection or settlement, issued by any of the entities stipulated in the preceding article, shall be considered an "enforceable instrument <orig>سند تنفيذي</orig>", subject to expedited enforcement by force of law. Its enforcement shall follow the rules and provisions stipulated in the aforementioned Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure.

## Article Five

Upon denial, a claim for fees and financial charges for the use of public utilities and services due to the state shall not be heard after the lapse of ten years from their due date. For annual fees, this period begins at the end of the year in which they are due. The statute of limitations stipulated in the preceding paragraph shall be interrupted by any notice directed by the creditor entity to the debtor that includes a statement of the value of these dues and the necessity of their payment. This notice shall be by any of the means of notification stipulated in the aforementioned Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure.

## Article Six

The provisions of this decree-by-law shall not apply to judicial fees.

## Article Seven

The ministers – each within their jurisdiction – shall implement this decree-by-law, and it shall come into force three months after the date of its publication in the Official Gazette / Al-Jarida Al-Rasmiya <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>.

And since the right of privilege is a priority established by law for a specific right in consideration of its nature, Article Three of the draft stipulates that amounts due to any of the state's ministries or its institutions, pursuant to the provisions of this law, shall have a privilege over all the debtor's assets, whether movable or immovable.
On the other hand, the draft decree-law was introduced to facilitate the state's collection of its dues from its debtors for these fees and charges, as the previous situation required the state to file lawsuits against them to claim these amounts, a process prolonged by lengthy litigation procedures until a final judgment was issued. Therefore, Article Four thereof stipulates that the document evidencing the debt owed by the debtor, or the decision for its collection or settlement issued by any of those entities, shall be considered an "executory instrument," subject to expedited enforcement by force of law. Its enforcement shall follow the rules and provisions stipulated in the Civil and Commercial Procedure Law issued by Decree-Law No. (38) of 1980.
And whereas the amounts collected by the public authority for public utility services from which it does not seek material gain, such as telecommunications, transportation, electricity, and water, are considered fees and are subject to the statute of limitations stipulated in the first paragraph of Article 441 of the Civil Code; and whereas it is a condition for the interruption of the limitation period, according to that provision, that the debtor acknowledges the debt and that this acknowledgment is made during the currency of the limitation period; therefore, it was deemed appropriate in Article Five of the draft to introduce a new case for interrupting the limitation period, which is by any notice sent by those entities to the debtor containing a statement of the value of these dues and the necessity of their payment. The rationale for this new provision lies in the large number of debtors who refrain from paying these fees—despite their ability to do so—which has made it difficult for government entities to file lawsuits against most of them to claim these amounts, resulting in the right to collect them being extinguished by the statute of limitations.
And since the draft has dedicated a special regulation for judicial fees, namely the Judicial Fees Law No. 17 of 1973, and has made their assessment and collection governed by the procedures stipulated in Article 123 of the Civil and Commercial Procedure Law, it was therefore deemed appropriate to stipulate in Article Six of the draft that its provisions shall not apply to them.
Article Seven of the draft decree-law obligates the Ministers, each within his own jurisdiction, to implement its provisions, and it stipulates its effective date to be three months after the date of its publication in the Official Gazette.

k) her labor entitlements for her overdue salaries, end-of-service indemnity, payment in lieu of notice, and consideration for a percentage of income, and for the appellant to pay her (1%) of her total entitlements, amounting to KWD <orig>د.ك</orig> 5,061.956 monthly from the date of filing the labor complaint until full payment. This is based on the claim that she joined the appellant's employment as a (dermatologist) on 4/3/2017 with a monthly salary of KWD <orig>د.ك</orig> 4,000, and continued to work until the contract ended on 23/7/2023. She did not receive her labor entitlements, so she filed a complaint with the Labor Disputes Department <orig>إدارة منازعات العمل</orig>, which did not result in a settlement of the dispute, leading her to file her lawsuit.
The court appointed an expert. After the expert submitted his report, the representative of the appellant submitted a memorandum pleading the unconstitutionality of Article (55) of Law No. (6) of 2010 regarding Labor in the Private Sector, for its violation of Articles (16), (20), and (22) of the Constitution.

12 Dhu al-Hijjah 1446 AH - 8/6/2025 AD

In the session of 11/12/2024, the court ruled that the plea of unconstitutionality was not serious. On the merits, it ordered the appellant to pay the respondent her labor entitlements as concluded by the appointed expert in his report, including the end-of-service indemnity and the consideration for a percentage of income, and rejected the remaining claims.
As the appellant was not satisfied with the latter judgment's ruling on the lack of seriousness of the plea of unconstitutionality, she appealed it before the Appeals Review Committee of the Constitutional Court <orig>لجنة فحص الطعون بالمحكمة الدستورية</orig> through a statement of claim filed with the clerk's office of this court on 9/1/2025. It was registered under No. (1) for the year 2025. At the conclusion of the statement, she requested the annulment of the judgment ruling the plea of unconstitutionality as not serious, and the referral of the matter to the Constitutional Court – in its full bench – for a decision.
This court reviewed the appeal in the session of 14/5/2025, as detailed in the session minutes. The appellant's representative insisted on the claims stated in the statement of appeal. The representative of the Fatwa and Legislation Department <orig>إدارة الفتوى والتشريع</orig> submitted a memorandum with the government's opinion, requesting at its conclusion a ruling primarily for the inadmissibility of the appeal and, alternatively, for its rejection. The court decided to issue its judgment on the appeal in today's session.

## The Court
After reviewing the documents, hearing the oral arguments, and after deliberation.
Whereas the appeal has fulfilled the legally prescribed conditions.
Whereas the appellant faults the appealed judgment for deficiency in reasoning and flawed inference, as it ruled that the plea of unconstitutionality she raised regarding Article (55) of Labor Law No. (6) of 2010 <orig>قانون العمل رقم (6) لسنة 2010</orig> was not serious, in what it contained regarding the definition of the wage received by the worker, despite it bordering on suspicion of unconstitutionality. This is because an agreement for the worker to receive a percentage of the revenue as an incentive bonus results, under the contested provision, in the worker receiving this bonus twice: first, upon achieving the agreed-upon percentage, and second, at the end of service when calculating the end-of-service indemnity. This contradicts the principles of social justice, undermines the achievement of economic development and increased production, and violates Articles (16), (20), and (22) of the Constitution.
Whereas this argument is rejected based on the established precedent of this court, which holds that the assessment of the seriousness of a plea of unconstitutionality depends on the convergence of two necessary conditions: first, that a ruling on the constitutional issue is necessary for resolving the substantive dispute, and second, that there is an apparent suspicion that the legislative text subject to the plea violates the provisions of the Constitution. It is also established that the oversight exercised by the Constitutional Court regarding the constitutionality of legislative texts is predicated on the legislative text's violation of a provision in the Constitution, and it is not concerned with the manner of its application, as this matter falls outside the scope of its oversight.

## Appeals Examination Committee
## of the Constitutional Court

In the session held publicly at the Court on 1 Dhu al-Hijjah 1446 H, corresponding to May 28, 2025 G

Presided over by Justice / Adel Ali Al-Buhouh <orig>عادل علي البحوه</orig>, President of the Court
With the membership of Justices /
Ibrahim Abdulrahman Al-Saif <orig>إبراهيم عبد الرحمن السيف</orig> and Walid Ibrahim Al-Moajil <orig>وليد إبراهيم المعجل</orig>
And in the presence of Mr. / Mohammed Mubarak Al-Dhaen <orig>محمد مبارك الضاعن</orig>, Clerk of the Session

### The following judgment was issued:
In the appeal registered in the records of the Constitutional Court under No. (2) of 2025 "Appeals Examination Committee"
Filed by:
GAK Al-Moatamada for Import and Export Company <orig>شركة جي إيه كي المعتمدة للاستيراد والتصدير</orig>
Against:
Gulf Bank <orig>بنك الخليج</orig>

### The Facts
Whereas the summary of the facts—as is apparent from the appealed judgment and other case documents—is that the appellant company (GAK Al-Moatamada for Import and Export Company <orig>شركة جي إيه كي المعتمدة للاستيراد والتصدير</orig>) filed lawsuit No. (33) of 2025, Commercial/Civil, Plenary, Government/6 (Capital Markets) against the respondent bank, seeking a judgment: (First) on an urgent basis: to halt the procedures for the liquidation and sale of the shares it owns under the two mortgage contracts Nos. (86) and (88), Volume/3, dated 10/1/2023, pending a decision on the substantive claims. (Second) before deciding on the merits: to refer the case to the Constitutional Court to rule on the constitutionality and legality of Articles (9-13) and (9-14) of Book Eleven of the Executive Regulations of Law No. (7) of 2010, for their violation of the law, particularly Articles (231) through (233) and Article (237) of the Commercial Code, and the articles of Part Three of the Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure. (Third) on the merits: (primarily) for the annulment of the mortgage on the shares of (ASEC Company for Manufacturing <orig>شركة أسيكو للصناعات</orig>) owned by the appellant and deposited in an investment portfolio held by the respondent bank, with all its ensuing effects, most notably the cancellation of the mortgage, the annulment of the sale of said shares, deeming it null and void, and the re-registration of the shares in the appellant's name; and (alternatively) for the annulment of the sale procedures for the aforementioned shares with all its ensuing effects. This is based on the claim that the respondent bank mortgaged the shares owned by the appellant in ASEC Company for Manufacturing <orig>شركة أسيكو للصناعات</orig> under the two aforementioned mortgage contracts, as security for the debt of (Al-Nakhil Club Hotel Company <orig>شركة فندق نادي</orig>

That being the case, and whereas Article (55) of Law No. (6) of 2010 regarding Work in the Private Sector—the article being challenged—defined the wage that a worker receives or should receive in exchange for and because of his work as the basic salary plus all elements stipulated in the employment contract or the employer's regulations. The calculation of the wage includes allowances, bonuses, benefits, grants, gifts, or cash advantages that the worker receives periodically. The article then provided for the determination of a worker's wage as a share of the net profits. Determining the wage in this manner does not, in itself, infringe upon the principles of social justice, as long as these elements have been agreed upon between the employer and the worker. This was confirmed by the appellant, who did not object to the respondent receiving her wage according to the aforementioned elements agreed upon in the employment contract between them. As for determining the end-of-service indemnity that the worker receives, how it is calculated, and which wage elements are included therein—which is the core of the substantive dispute between the two parties—this falls within the purview of the trial court when applying the aforementioned challenged provision. It is therefore outside the scope of this Court's review, as it is not concerned with how the provision is applied. Consequently, the plea of unconstitutionality lacks the elements of seriousness.
Based on the foregoing, and since the appealed judgment concluded that the plea of unconstitutionality was not serious, its outcome is legally sound. Therefore, the appeal must be dismissed, and the appellant shall be ordered to pay the costs.

### For These Reasons
The Court has ruled: to accept the appeal in form, to dismiss it in substance, and to order the appellant to pay the costs.

Clerk of the Session
President of the CourtAl-Nakhil <orig>النخيل</orig>) given that the appellant is an in-rem guarantor for this debt by virtue of those shares. The appellant was surprised in September 2024 when the bank proceeded to sell and liquidate the mortgaged shares. The sale procedures were allegedly flawed because the person who signed the two mortgage contracts was not issued a special power of attorney for that purpose, the secured debt was not precisely defined in the two contracts, the appellant, as an in-rem guarantor, was not notified within the legally specified period before the sale, and due to the unconstitutionality of Articles (9-13) and (9-14) of Chapter Nine of Book Eleven of the Executive Regulations of the Law Establishing the Capital Markets Authority. This prompted it to file its lawsuit with the aforementioned claims.

In the session of 18/2/2025, the court ruled that the plea of unconstitutionality was not serious, and on the merits of the case, it was dismissed.
As the appellant was not satisfied with the latter judgment's finding regarding the lack of seriousness of the plea of unconstitutionality, she challenged it before the Appeals Examination Committee of the Constitutional Court through a statement of claim filed with the clerk's office of this court on 13/3/2025, where it was registered under No. (2) for the year 2025. At the conclusion of the statement, she requested the annulment of the judgment ruling the plea of unconstitutionality as not serious, and the referral of the matter to the Constitutional Court – in its full bench – for a decision.
This court reviewed the appeal in the session of 14/5/2025 as detailed in the session minutes. The representative for the appellant submitted a portfolio of documents and insisted on the requests stated in the statement of appeal. The representative for the respondent bank submitted a portfolio of documents and a memorandum requesting the dismissal of the appeal. The representative of the Fatwa and Legislation Department <orig>إدارة الفتوى والتشريع</orig> submitted a memorandum with the government's opinion, requesting primarily that the appeal be deemed inadmissible and, alternatively, that it be dismissed. The court decided to issue its judgment on the appeal in today's session.

## The Court
After reviewing the documents, hearing the oral arguments, and after deliberation.
Whereas the appeal has fulfilled the legally prescribed conditions.
Whereas the appellant faults the challenged judgment for inadequacy in reasoning and flawed inference, as it ruled that the plea of unconstitutionality of Articles (9-13) and (9-14) of Chapter Nine of Book Eleven of the Executive Regulations of the Law Establishing the Capital Markets Authority <orig>هيئة أسواق المال</orig> No. (7) of 2010 was not serious. These articles stipulate that if the mortgagee creditor is a bank or financial institution and the debtor or mortgagor is a professional client, it is permissible to agree, at the time of concluding the mortgage contract or thereafter, on the right of the mortgagee creditor—in the event of the debtor's default on his obligations—to take ownership of the mortgaged property or sell it without being bound by the provisions stipulated in Articles (231) to (233) of the Commercial Code, as well as the provisions stipulated in Book Three of the Civil and Commercial Procedure Law. This is despite the fact that these provisions have disregarded the aforementioned legal provisions, which renders them both unconstitutional and unlawful for violating the principle of legislative hierarchy, in addition to violating the principle of equality by exempting a class of creditors and mortgagor debtors from the procedures guaranteed by law to protect the mortgagor debtor in the aforementioned legal articles, while all creditors and mortgagor debtors of shares are in the same legal position, which violates Articles (7) and (29) of the Constitution.
Whereas this argument is refuted by what has been established—in the jurisprudence of this court—that the assessment of the seriousness of a plea of unconstitutionality requires the convergence of two necessary conditions: first, that a ruling on the constitutional issue is necessary for resolving the substantive dispute, and second, that there is an apparent suspicion that the legislative text subject to the plea violates the provisions of the Constitution.
Given that, and since the jurisprudence of this court has established that equality before the law is achieved by the presence of the conditions of generality and abstraction in the legal rule, and that the prohibited discrimination is that which is arbitrary, discrimination based on objective grounds and required by the public interest does not conflict with the principle of equality. The Law Establishing the Capital Markets Authority <orig>هيئة أسواق المال</orig> No. (7) of 2010—as amended by Law No. (22) of 2015—has, in Article (5), Clause (8), authorized the Capital Markets Authority <orig>هيئة أسواق المال</orig> to establish rules governing the trading and transfer of ownership of securities without being subject to the provisions of Articles (231), (232), (233), and (237) of the Commercial Code, as well as rules governing the execution on securities without being bound by the provisions stipulated in the Procedure Law. In implementation thereof, the Executive Regulations of the law, in Chapter Nine of Book Eleven, specified the procedures for mortgaging securities, and in Article (9-13) of that chapter—the one being challenged—it permitted the sale or ownership of mortgaged securities in the event of the debtor's default on his obligations without being bound by the legal provisions in this regard in the Commercial Code or the Procedure Law. This is based on a general, abstract rule that applies when the mortgagee creditor is a bank or financial institution and the debtor or mortgagor is a professional client, without distinction or discrimination among them, according to an objective criterion linked to the goal sought by the legislator in the legislative regulation of securities trading to achieve the public interest. Thus, the text has not violated the principle of equality. As for the argument of violating the principle of legislative hierarchy, it—even assuming its validity—is a matter related to the legality of that text, and is not considered a constitutional matter, and thus falls outside the review of this court. Since the challenged judgment concluded that the plea of unconstitutionality was not serious, it has reached a correct conclusion, and the appeal against it is based on unsound grounds. Therefore, it must be dismissed, and the appellant must be ordered to pay the costs.

For these reasons
The Court has ruled: to accept the appeal in form, to dismiss it on the merits, and to order the appellant to pay the costs.

8. Legal Representative of the Kuwait Flour Mills & Bakeries Company <orig>شركة مطاحن الدقيق والمخابز الكويتية</orig>, in his capacity.

### The Facts
The summary of the facts, as is apparent from the appealed judgment and other documents, is that the appellant (Lulwa Saud Mohammed Al-Obaidi <orig>لولوه سعود محمد العبيدي</orig>) filed lawsuit No. (4474) of 2023, Commercial/Civil/Total/Government/4, against the respondents, seeking a judgment—according to her final requests—to confirm her registration with the Public Authority for Manpower <orig>الهيئة العامة للقوى العاملة</orig> based on the work permits issued to her and the resulting effects, and to compel the latter Authority to pay her the incentive bonus stipulated in the National Labor Support Program <orig>برنامج دعم العمالة الوطنية</orig> in the amount of (690 K.D.) monthly, from her date of appointment on 8/2/2018 until the end of her service on 23/1/2023, and the resulting effects. This was on the grounds that she worked for the (Kuwait Flour Mills & Bakeries Company <orig>شركة مطاحن الدقيق والمخابز الكويتية</orig>) starting on 8/2/2018 and continued to work until she submitted her resignation and her service ended on 23/1/2023. The said company refused to register her in the National Labor Support Program <orig>برنامج دعم العمالة الوطنية</orig> in implementation of the Council of Ministers' Resolution No. (391) of 2001 concerning the granting of the national labor support allowance. Consequently, she did not receive this support despite meeting all the necessary conditions to obtain it, which prompted her to file her lawsuit with the aforementioned requests.
At the session of 25/12/2024, the appellant submitted a memorandum specifying her final requests as stated above, and included a request to refer the case to the Constitutional Court due to the unconstitutionality of Resolution No. (390) of 2001 concerning the granting of the social allowance and children's allowance to employees in government agencies and wholly state-owned companies, for its violation of the public interest.
At the session of 19/3/2025, the court ruled that the plea of unconstitutionality was not serious, and on the merits of the case, it was dismissed.
As the appellant did not accept the latter judgment's ruling on the lack of seriousness of the plea of unconstitutionality, she appealed it before the Appeals Review Committee of the Constitutional Court through a statement of appeal filed with the clerk's office of this Court on 9/4/2025, where it was registered under No. (3) of 2025. At the conclusion of that statement, she requested the annulment of the judgment ruling the plea of unconstitutionality as not serious, and the referral of the matter to the Constitutional Court—in its full bench—for a decision.
This Court reviewed the appeal at the session of 14/5/2025 in the manner detailed in its minutes. The representative for the appellant submitted a portfolio of documents and a memorandum in which she insisted on her requests. The Public Institution for Social Security <orig>المؤسسة العامة للتأمينات الاجتماعية</orig> submitted a memorandum requesting at its conclusion that the appeal be deemed inadmissible with respect to it. The representative of the Fatwa and Legislation Department <orig>إدارة الفتوى والتشريع</orig> present on behalf of the government submitted a memorandum requesting at its conclusion that the appeal be dismissed. The Court decided to issue its judgment on the appeal at today's session.

### The Court
After reviewing the documents, hearing the oral arguments, and after deliberation.
Whereas it is established—and in accordance with the jurisprudence of this Court—that only a party to the litigation in which the appealed judgment was issued may be named as a respondent in the appeal, and whereas it is established from the documents that the eighth respondent (the Legal Representative of the Kuwait Flour Mills & Bakeries Company <orig>شركة مطاحن الدقيق والمخابز الكويتية</orig>, in his capacity) was not a party to the substantive case in which the plea of unconstitutionality was raised, therefore, he may not be named as a respondent in this appeal due to lack of standing, and thus, the appeal must be ruled inadmissible with respect to him.
Whereas the appeal—aside from the foregoing—has fulfilled its legally prescribed conditions.
Whereas the appellant faults the appealed judgment for deficiency in reasoning and flawed inference, as it ruled that the plea she raised regarding the unconstitutionality of Resolution No. (390) of 2001 concerning the granting of the social allowance and children's allowance to employees in government agencies and wholly state-owned companies was not serious, despite the suspicion of unconstitutionality surrounding its provision in clause No. (4) of Article No. (1) regarding the subjection of

Whereas this appeal is refuted by what has been established – in the jurisprudence of this Court – that a plea of unconstitutionality of a legislative text raised by one of the litigants in a dispute before the trial court does not invoke its jurisdiction to assess the seriousness of this plea unless it pertains to the specific legislative text or texts identified by the pleader, the constitutional provision it allegedly violates, and the grounds for the violation and the objections directed at the text, so that these essential details define the scope, subject, and extent of the plea of unconstitutionality, thereby negating any lack of clarity, enabling the trial court to assess its seriousness under the supervision of this Court. It is also established that an appeal before the Appeals Examination Committee is nothing more than a challenge to the judgment that found the plea of unconstitutionality to be not serious. This judgment is the focus and subject of the dispute in the appeal, as the supervision of this Court is naturally limited to what the contested judgment addressed concerning this part.
This being the case, and as it is evident from the appellant's amended statement of claims before the trial court and her memorandum submitted at the session of 12/25/2024, that she had pleaded the unconstitutionality of Decision No. (390) of 2001 concerning the granting of social allowance and children's allowance to employees in government agencies and wholly state-owned companies, and limited the reasons for her appeal against this decision to its violation of the public interest, without citing the constitutional provisions that the text allegedly violates, the grounds for the violation, or the constitutional objections directed against it. Nor did she provide the Appeals Examination Committee with any evidence that she had clarified this before the trial court in a manner that would remove ambiguity and lack of clarity from her plea. As the contested judgment concluded that the plea of unconstitutionality was not serious, it has reached a correct conclusion. This is not altered by the appellant's arguments in her statement of appeal regarding the contested decision's violation of the principle of equality, as what matters are the reasons for the plea presented before the trial court and the judgment's response to them, which define the scope of the dispute before the Appeals Examination Committee.
Given the foregoing, the appeal against the contested judgment's conclusion that the plea of unconstitutionality was not serious is without basis, which necessitates dismissing the appeal and ordering the appellant to pay the costs.
For these reasons
The Court has ruled:
First: To dismiss the appeal in form, with respect to the eighth respondent.
Second: To accept the appeal in form with respect to the first through seventh respondents, to reject it in substance, and to order the appellant to pay the costs.

## Appeals Examination Committee of the Constitutional Court
In the session held publicly at the Court on 1 Dhu al-Hijjah 1446 H, corresponding to May 28, 2025 AD
Presided over by Mr. Justice / Adel Ali Al-Bahouh <orig>عادل علي البــــــحوه</orig>, President of the Court, with the membership of the two Justices /
Saleh Khalifa Al-Murished <orig>صالح خليفة المريشد</orig> and Abdulrahman Mishari Al-Darmi <orig>عبدالرحمن مشاري الدارمي</orig>
And in the presence of Mr. / Mohammed Mubarak Al-Dhaen <orig>محمد مبارك الضاعن</orig>, Clerk of the Court Session
The following judgment was issued:
In the appeal registered in the records of the Constitutional Court under No. (4) of 2025
"Appeals Examination Committee"
Filed by:
Abdulsalam Khalid Mufreh Al-Anzi <orig>عبد السلام خالد مفرح العنزي</orig>
Against:
1- Undersecretary of the Ministry of Education <orig>وزارة التربية</orig>, in his capacity.
2- President of the Civil Service Commission <orig>ديوان الخدمة المدنية</orig>, in his capacity.
3- Director of the Public Authority for Disability Affairs <orig>الهيئة العامة لشئون ذوي الإعاقة</orig>, in his capacity.
## The Facts
Whereas the summary of the facts – as it appears from the contested judgment and other documents – is that the appellant (Abdulsalam Khalid Mufreh Al-Anzi <orig>عبد السلام خالد مفرح العنزي</orig>) filed lawsuit No. (6061) of 2024, Plenary Administrative/14, against the respondents in their capacities, requesting a judgment – according to the court of first instance's characterization of his claims – (First) to stay the proceedings and refer the case to the Constitutional Court to rule on the constitutionality of the second paragraph of Article (42) of Law No. (8) of 2010 regarding the rights of persons with disabilities, for its violation of Articles (9) and (29) of the Constitution, (Second) On the merits: to annul the administration's implicit decision to refrain from referring him to retirement and to apply the provision of Article (42) of the aforementioned Law No. (8) of 2010 in his favor, with all its ensuing effects, most notably the preservation of his full financial rights and the initiation of procedures for the disbursement of his pension at a rate of (100%) of his salary from the Public Institution for Social Security <orig>المؤسسة العامة للتأمينات الاجتماعية</orig>, on the grounds that he has been working at the Ministry of Education <orig>وزارة التربية</orig> since 3/28/2007 until the present, has a service period exceeding (17) years, and that God has blessed him with a son (Khalid) who suffers from a "severe physical" disability, for whom he is legally responsible for care. On 8/25/2024, he submitted a request to be referred to retirement as a person legally responsible for the care of a disabled person, in application of Article (42) of Law No. (8) of 2010, but his request received no response.

And in the session of 26/3/2025, the court ruled that the plea of unconstitutionality was not serious, and that the lawsuit was inadmissible due to the absence of an administrative decision.
As the appellant was not satisfied with the latter judgment's ruling regarding the lack of seriousness of the plea of unconstitutionality, he appealed it before the Appeals Examination Committee of the Constitutional Court through a statement of claim filed with the clerk's office of this court on 23/4/2025, and registered in its records under No. (4) for the year 2025. At the conclusion of the said statement, he requested the annulment of the judgment ruling the plea of unconstitutionality as not serious, and the referral of the matter to the Constitutional Court – in its full bench – for a decision.
This court reviewed the appeal in its session of 14/5/2025 as detailed in its minutes. The representative for the appellant submitted a portfolio of documents and insisted on the requests stated in the statement of appeal. The representative of the Fatwa and Legislation Department <orig>إدارة الفتوى والتشريع</orig>, present on behalf of the government, submitted a memorandum requesting, in its conclusion, a primary ruling of inadmissibility of the appeal and, alternatively, its rejection. The court decided to issue its judgment on the appeal in today's session.

## The Court
After reviewing the documents, hearing the oral arguments, and after deliberation.
Whereas the appeal has fulfilled the legally prescribed conditions.
Whereas the appellant faults the appealed judgment for deficiency in reasoning and flawed inference, as it ruled that the plea he raised regarding the unconstitutionality of the second paragraph of Article (42) of Law No. (8) of 2010 concerning the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was not serious, despite the suspicion of unconstitutionality surrounding its stipulation of a service period calculated for the pension of (20) years for males and (15) years for females, for the insured person or the beneficiary legally responsible for caring for a person with a moderate or severe disability to receive a retirement pension equivalent to (100%) of the salary, for its violation of the principle of equality and its inclusion of unjustified discrimination between males and females, in contravention of Article (29) of the Constitution.
Whereas this argument is refuted by what has been established – in the jurisprudence of this court – that the assessment of the seriousness of a plea of unconstitutionality requires the convergence of two necessary conditions: first, that a ruling on the constitutional issue is necessary for resolving the substantive dispute, and second, that there is an apparent suspicion that the legislative text subject to the plea violates the provisions of the Constitution. It is also established that the assessment of the seriousness of the plea of unconstitutionality is primarily entrusted to the trial court without review, provided that it bases its judgment on sound reasons that lead to the conclusion it reached.
This being the case, and since the appealed judgment based its ruling on the lack of seriousness of the plea of unconstitutionality on the grounds that the application of the principle of equality is not based on opposing all forms of discrimination, as some are based on objective grounds, which means that the prohibited discrimination is that which is arbitrary. The contested text does not in any way involve differentiation between the sexes, as it did not restrict obtaining a retirement pension in the cases it specified to one sex over the other. Rather, it set a condition related to the service period for the applicant for the retirement pension, making it (20) years for males and (15) years for females. This is a distinction not created by that text but finds its origin in the Social Insurance Law itself, which differentiated the retirement age between males and females. The legislator's rationale in this was to take into account various social considerations based on the public interest and its requirement that the duration of a woman's presence in the workforce be less than a man's to achieve the interest of the family and society, and not as arbitrary discrimination between the sexes. Consequently, the plea of unconstitutionality lacks the elements of seriousness.
Given that, and since the conclusion reached by the appealed judgment in this regard is sound, contains a sufficient response to the grounds of the plea presented by the appellant, and is sufficient to support the judgment's ruling in this matter, the appeal against it is found to be based on unsound grounds. Therefore, it must be ruled to be rejected, and the appellant shall be ordered to pay the costs.

## For These Reasons
The Court has ruled: to accept the appeal in form, to reject it in substance, and to order the appellant to pay the costs.
