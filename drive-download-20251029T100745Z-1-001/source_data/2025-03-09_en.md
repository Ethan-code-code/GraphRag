# Ministry of Justice
## Announcement
On the occasion of the issuance of the decision by the Bankruptcy Judge / Zaid Al-Attar <orig>زيد العطار</orig> dated 17/2/2025 in Petition No. (23/2024) Declaration of Bankruptcy.
Submitted by / The Insurance Regulatory Unit.
Against / Ghazal Insurance Company <orig>شركة غزال للتأمين</orig>.
We hereby publish the aforementioned decision of the Bankruptcy Judge in the Official Gazette.
Head of the Bankruptcy Department
In the name of His Highness the Amir of the State of Kuwait
Sheikh Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah <orig>الشيخ مشعل الأحمد الجابر الصباح</orig>
Court of First Instance
Decision
On Monday, 17/2/2025, at the headquarters of the Bankruptcy Department
With the membership of Mr. / Zaid Abdul Hadi Al-Attar <orig>زيد عبد الهادي العطار</orig>, Bankruptcy Judge
And in the presence of Mr. / Khalid Abdullah Al-Qaisi <orig>خالد عبد الله القيسي</orig>, Secretary
In Petition No: (23/2024 Declaration of Bankruptcy)
Registered under automated number: 240825520
Submitted by: The Insurance Regulatory Unit
Against/ Ghazal Insurance Company <orig>شركة غزال للتأمين</orig>
After reviewing the documents and the trustee's letter requesting permission to open the portal for claims electronically and to approve a nominal, non-refundable fee to cover the costs of the process, and in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Law and its executive regulations:
The facts of the present petition are encompassed by the Bankruptcy Judge's decision issued on 26/6/2024, accepting the petition and initiating the bankruptcy declaration procedures against Ghazal Insurance Company <orig>شركة غزال للتأمين</orig>, setting the petition submission date of 29/2/2024 as a temporary date for the cessation of payments, and appointing the trustee to perform the tasks contained therein, to which we refer to avoid repetition.
Whereas, as stipulated in Article (105) of the Bankruptcy Law, "The Bankruptcy Department shall notify the trustee of the decision for their appointment within ten days from the date of its issuance, and it must provide them with all available information about the debtor. The debtor, within ten days from the date of being notified of the appointment decision, must do the following:
1- Announce a summary of the decision to initiate the procedures, provided that the announcement includes an invitation to creditors to submit their claims and supporting documents and deliver them to the trustee within a period not exceeding one month from the date of the announcement.
2- Notify all creditors whose electronic addresses are known to provide the trustee with their claims and documents within one month from the date of the announcement of the summary of the decision to initiate procedures. The debtor must provide the trustee with any additional details not previously notified to the Bankruptcy Department, whether regarding their creditors, the amounts of debts, details of any contracts under execution, or any pending or ongoing judicial proceedings to which the debtor is a party, within the timeframe specified by the trustee."
Guided by the foregoing, and as the trustee has requested permission to open the portal for claims electronically due to the impossibility of manually compiling them given their vast quantity, and to approve a nominal fee for submitting the claim to cover the costs of the process self-sufficiently without burdening the bankruptcy estate with any additional charges for a period of three months from the date of publishing the decision in the Official Gazette, renewable; and whereas Article (105) of the Bankruptcy Law has specified a period of one month, starting from the date of the announcement, for creditors to submit their claims and supporting documents and deliver them to the trustee, we therefore decide to open the portal for claims electronically for a period of one month from the date of publishing and announcing this decision in the Official Gazette, with the approval of a nominal, non-refundable fee to cover the costs of the process.
Therefore, we have decided:
1- To open the portal for claims electronically for a period of one month from the date of publishing and announcing this decision in the Official Gazette, with the approval of a nominal, non-refundable fee to cover the costs of the process.
2- The Bankruptcy Department shall provide the trustee with a true copy of this decision, publish and announce it in the Official Gazette, and legally notify the concerned parties thereof.
Secretary
Bankruptcy Judge
In accordance with Article (8) of the Bankruptcy Law, decisions issued by the Bankruptcy Judge are executory instruments according to this law. The Bankruptcy Department shall affix the writ of execution to them, and they shall be enforceable immediately upon issuance and without announcement.
