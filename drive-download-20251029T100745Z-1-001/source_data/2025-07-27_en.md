Whereas this Agreement serves the interest of Kuwait and does not conflict with its commitments in the Arab and international spheres, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs <orig>وزارة الخارجية</orig> has requested the preparation of the necessary legal instrument for ratification.
And whereas this Agreement is considered one of the agreements mentioned in the second paragraph of Article (70) of the Constitution, and therefore its approval must be by law in accordance with the provision of this paragraph, and based on Article Four of the Amiri Order issued on 10/5/2024, which stipulated that laws shall be issued by decree-laws, a draft decree-law has therefore been prepared for the approval of this Agreement.
Its first article stipulated the approval of the aforementioned Agreement, and its second article obligates the ministers, each within their respective jurisdictions, to implement this decree-law, and that it shall come into force from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>.

### Promotion, Admission and Protection of Investments

1. Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create more favorable conditions for investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party in its territory, and in accordance with the rights granted to it by virtue of its laws, shall admit such investments.

2. The Contracting Parties shall use their best efforts to promote investments through the exchange of information, including but not limited to:
(a) any existing dispute concerning the potential investor;
(b) the shareholders of the potential investor if established as a company;
(c) the type of business activity practiced by the potential investor;

5. Once investments are established, investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be subject to additional performance requirements which may be detrimental to their viability or adversely affect their use, management, conduct, operation, expansion, sale, or other disposition.

6. Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with its laws and regulations relating to the entry, stay and work of natural persons, examine in good faith and give due consideration, regardless of nationality, to applications of key personnel including top managerial and technical persons who are employed for the purposes of investments in its territory to enter, stay temporarily and work in the territory of the host Contracting Party. The immediate family members of such key personnel shall be granted similar treatment with regard to the entry and temporary stay in the host Contracting Party.

## Article 3
### National Treatment

1.

2. Each Contracting Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments in its territory of its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, sale or other disposition of investments.

3. The provisions of this Article shall not, however, be construed so as to oblige one Contracting Party to extend to the investors of the other Contracting Party the benefit of any treatment, preference or privilege resulting from:
(a) any customs union, economic union, free trade area, monetary union, or any other form of regional economic arrangement or any similar international agreement, to which either of the Contracting Parties is or may become a party;

2. Without prejudice to paragraph (1) of this Article, investors of one Contracting Party who in any of the events referred to in that paragraph suffer damage or loss in the territory of the other Contracting Party resulting from:
(a) the requisitioning of their investment or a part thereof by its forces or authorities;
(b) or the destruction of their investment or a part thereof by its forces or authorities, which was not caused in combat action or was not required by the necessity of the situation,
shall be accorded restitution or adequate and effective compensation for the damage or loss sustained during the period of the requisitioning or as a result of the destruction of their property. The resulting payments shall be in a freely convertible currency.

## Article 6
### Expropriation

Neither Contracting Party shall directly or indirectly expropriate or nationalize an investment in its territory of an investor of the other Contracting Party or take any measure or measures having an equivalent effect (hereinafter referred to as "expropriation") except:
(1) for a purpose which is in the public interest.
(2) on a non-discriminatory basis.
(3) in accordance with due process of law, and
(4) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation.

b) Such compensation shall be equivalent to the market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier. It shall be determined and computed in accordance with internationally recognized principles of valuation and shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of payment, shall be made without delay, be effectively realizable, and be in a freely convertible currency of the investor's choice. The investor affected shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, to a prompt review, by a judicial or other independent authority of that Party, of his or its case and of the valuation of his or its investment in accordance with the principles set out in this paragraph.

2. For greater certainty, where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its own territory, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article are applied to the extent permitted to guarantee prompt, adequate and effective compensation in respect of their investment to such investors of the other Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.

3. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "expropriation" shall also include any interventions or regulatory measures by a Contracting Party that have a de facto expropriatory effect, where their effect is to substantially deprive the investor of his ownership, control, or significant benefits over his investment or may result in loss or damage to the economic value of the investment.

4. Due process of law includes, in particular, the right of an investor of a Contracting Party who claims to be affected by expropriation by the other Contracting Party to a prompt review of his case, including the valuation of his investment and the payment of compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Article, by a judicial authority or other competent authority of the latter Contracting Party.

## Article 7
### Transfers

Each Contracting Party shall guarantee that all payments relating to an investment in its territory by an investor of the other Contracting Party may be freely transferred into and out of its territory without delay. Such transfers shall include, in particular, but not exclusively:
(a) the initial capital and additional amounts to maintain or increase the investment;
(b) profits, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties, fees and other current income accruing from the investments;
(c) payments made under a contract including a loan in connection with the investments;
(d) the proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all or any part of the investments;
(e) payments of compensation under Articles 5, 6 and 8 of this Agreement;
(f) payments arising out of the settlement of an investment dispute under Articles 10 and 11 of this Agreement;
(g) earnings and remuneration of personnel engaged from abroad in connection with the investment.

1. Transfers of payments under paragraph (1) shall be effected without delay or restriction and in a freely convertible currency, except in the case of payments in kind. In case of a delay in effecting the required transfers, the affected investor shall be entitled to receive interest for the period of such delay.

2. Each Contracting Party shall guarantee that transfers under paragraph 1 of this Article shall be made in a freely convertible currency at the official rate of exchange prevailing

### Subrogation

3. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "expropriation" shall also include any interventions or regulatory measures by a Contracting Party that have a de facto expropriatory effect, in that their effect results in depriving the investor in fact from his ownership, control or substantial benefits over his investment or which may result in loss or damage to the economic value of the investment.

4. Due process of law includes, in particular, the right of an investor of a Contracting Party which claims to be affected by expropriation by another Contracting Party to prompt review of its case, including the valuation of its investment and the payment of compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Article, by a judicial authority or another competent authority of the latter Contracting Party.

## Article 7
## Transfers

1. Each Contracting Party shall ensure that all payments relating to an investment in its territory of an investor of another Contracting Party may be freely transferred into and out of its territory without delay. Such transfers shall include, in particular, though not exclusively:
    (a) the initial capital and additional amounts to maintain or increase an investment;
    (b) profits, interests, capital gains, dividends, royalties, fees and other current income accruing from investments;
    (c) payments made under a contract including a loan connected with the investments;
    (d) proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all or any part of the investments;

C., 18 March 1965 (the "Washington Convention"), if both Contracting Parties are parties to the Washington Convention and the Washington Convention is applicable to the dispute;

(2) The Centre, under the rules governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of the Centre (the "Additional Facility Rules"), if the Contracting Party of the investor or the Contracting Party to the dispute, but not both, is a party to the Washington Convention;

(b) an ad hoc arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), as those Rules may be modified by the parties to the dispute (the Appointing Authority referred to under Article 7 of the Rules shall be the Secretary General of the Centre);

(c) or an arbitral tribunal constituted pursuant to the arbitration rules of any arbitral institution mutually agreed upon between the parties to the dispute.

4. Notwithstanding the fact that the investor may have submitted a dispute to binding arbitration under paragraph 3, it may, prior to the institution of the arbitral proceeding or during the proceeding, seek before the judicial or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party that is a party to the dispute, interim injunctive relief for the preservation of its rights and interests, provided it does not include a request for payment of any damages.

5. In any proceedings, judicial, arbitral or otherwise or in an enforcement of any decision or award, concerning an investment dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, a Contracting Party shall not assert, as a defense, its sovereign immunity. Any counterclaim or right of set-off may not be based on the fact that the investor concerned has received or will receive, pursuant to an insurance contract, indemnification or other compensation for all or part of its alleged damages from any third party whomsoever, whether public or private, including such other Contracting Party and its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities.

The Bankruptcy Administration shall affix the writ of execution <orig>الصيغة التنفيذية</orig> to them, and they shall be enforceable immediately upon issuance and without notification.

Furthermore, the applicant company's business is capable of continuing, as its knowledge is based on a technical study by the Crowe Kuwait Consulting office <orig>مكتب كرو كويت للاستشارات</orig>, which is registered with the regulatory authorities. The debtor applicant has a plan to resume its activities and has future cash flows. The creditors are holders of ordinary debts. The total bank debts amount to two million, five hundred eighty-nine thousand and forty-one dinars <orig>دينار</orig>; the total supplier debts amount to one million, eight hundred forty-three thousand and eleven dinars <orig>دينار</orig>; and the total employee debts amount to one million, four hundred thirty-four thousand, three hundred and sixteen dinars <orig>دينار</orig>.

Evidence and documents were submitted demonstrating its ability to continue operations and amortize its losses in a short period. Document portfolios were submitted, the most important of which included a decision from an extraordinary general assembly <orig>جمعية عمومية غير عادية</orig>, a letter classifying creditors, amounts due, and guarantees provided, a copy of the list of goods and assets, and financial statements for banks, suppliers, and employees). Consequently, the company became unable to pay its debts as a result of this impediment.

At the session of 26/12/2024, the applicant company's lawyer submitted a defense memorandum and a portfolio of documents demonstrating its ability to continue operations and repay creditors' debts in light of the preventive settlement <orig>تسوية وقائية</orig> plan it submitted. The applicant company had outlined in its application a summary of the proposed preventive settlement <orig>تسوية وقائية</orig> and the agreements to be concluded with creditors regarding the settlement. It stated its desire to be granted sufficient time to settle the debts outstanding against it, in order to preserve the company's entity, the value of its assets, and the interests of its shareholders, while affirming its ability to fulfill all these debts.

At the session of 26/12/2024, a decision was issued by the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي افلاس</orig> (to address the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة الإفلاس</orig> to examine the application and provide an opinion thereon, indicating the feasibility of the preventive settlement <orig>تسوية وقائية</orig>, assessing the debtor's financial situation and the debts outstanding against it, stating whether or not precautionary measures should be taken, stating whether or not the debtor is capable of managing its business and funds on its own, and providing us with a detailed report on the matter, while working as much as possible to accomplish this within the legal deadlines prescribed for doing so under the Bankruptcy Law, and indicating the need to appoint an observer <orig>مراقب</orig> to examine the proposed preventive settlement <orig>تسوية وقائية</orig>, the measures taken, and the implementation of its proposal, and in the affirmative case, stating the value of the financial amount due to the observer <orig>مراقب</orig>, whether on a monthly or annual basis).

Whereas a letter was received from the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة افلاس</orig> dated 20/3/2025, stating that it is unable to provide an opinion due to deficiencies in some details, and refers to them in detail to avoid repetition.

Whereas the applicant's lawyer submitted three document portfolios, a flash memory drive, and a defense memorandum in response to the report of the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة افلاس</orig> and insisted on his requests.

At the session of 14/4/2025, a decision was issued (to re-address the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة الإفلاس</orig> in light of the final defense memorandum submitted by the applicant, its document portfolios, and the attached flash memory drive, in response to the letter from the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة افلاس</orig> dated [date missing], in order to "examine the application and provide an opinion thereon, indicating the feasibility of the preventive settlement <orig>تسوية وقائية</orig>, assessing the debtor's financial situation and the debts outstanding against it, stating whether or not precautionary measures should be taken, stating whether or not the debtor is capable of managing its business and funds on its own, and providing us with a detailed report on the matter, while working as much as possible to accomplish this within the legal deadlines prescribed for doing so under the Bankruptcy Law, and indicating the need to appoint an observer <orig>مراقب</orig> to examine the proposed preventive settlement <orig>تسوية وقائية</orig>, the measures taken, and the implementation of its proposal).

On 12/6/2025, a decision was issued to commence preventive settlement procedures, stay all claims, prepare a preventive settlement proposal by the applicant, and form a creditors' committee. The decision is referred to in detail. Regarding the appointment of a controller for the preventive settlement request, Article 1 of Bankruptcy Law No. 71 of 2020 stipulates (Controller: The person who follows up on the implementation of preventive settlement, restructuring, and bankruptcy declaration procedures through the information received from the debtor, the trustee, and the creditors).
Article (12, paragraph 3) of the Bankruptcy Law stipulates (The Bankruptcy Committee is responsible for: 3- Establishing a schedule of fees for trustees, controllers, and inspectors appointed in accordance with the provisions of this law, and any costs they incur due to preventive settlement, restructuring, or bankruptcy procedures, and presenting it to the Minister for approval).
Whereas, based on the foregoing and guided by it, the applicant company, in the session of 19/12/2024, agreed to the appointment of Ms. Rabia Saad Al-Muhanna <orig>رابعة سعد المهنا</orig> as a bankruptcy trustee. Likewise, in the same session, the aforementioned Ms. agreed to her appointment as a controller or bankruptcy trustee to examine this request. Furthermore, the Bankruptcy Committee, in its last letter dated 12/6/2025, concluded in its fifth clause (There is a need to appoint a controller to follow up on the preventive settlement procedures and supervise the company's financial affairs, and the proposed monthly fee is one thousand dinars per month). Based on the above, a decision is issued by the bankruptcy judge to appoint Ms. Rabia Saad Al-Muhanna <orig>رابعة سعد المهنا</orig> as a controller for Penta Furniture and Furnishings Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة بنتا للأثاث والمفروشات ذ.م.م</orig> to follow up on the preventive settlement procedures and supervise the company's financial affairs for a monthly salary of one thousand dinars, in accordance with the conclusion of the Bankruptcy Committee's report. This is to be calculated from 12/6/2025, the date the decision was issued to commence preventive settlement procedures, stay all claims, and prepare the preventive settlement proposal, until the date a final decision is issued on this request, its publication in the Official Gazette, and the notification of the parties in this regard, as will be stated in the operative part.
Therefore
The bankruptcy judge has decided: To appoint Ms. Rabia Saad Al-Muhanna <orig>رابعة سعد المهنا</orig> as a "controller" for Penta Furniture and Furnishings Co. W.L.L. <orig>شركة بنتا للأثاث والمفروشات ذ.م.م</orig> to follow up on the request for preventive settlement procedures and supervise the company's financial affairs. She is entitled to a monthly salary of KWD 1,000 (one thousand dinars) in accordance with the conclusion of the Bankruptcy Committee's report dated 12/6/2025, starting from today's date, 3/7/2025, until the final decision on this request is issued. This decision shall be published in the Official Gazette, and the Court Clerk's Office shall notify the parties in this regard.

It is also established, pursuant to the text of Article 21 of Law No. 41 of 1993 regarding the State's purchase of certain debts and the method of their collection, that (if the bankruptcy is closed due to the insufficiency of its funds, or if temporary distributions are made, or if sums are obtained as a result of a judicial composition or a composition with abandonment of assets, and upon the termination of the bankruptcy and in all cases where temporary or final distributions are made in accordance with the provisions of the Commercial Code, the Director shall receive these funds and distribute them to the creditors according to their share in the bankruptcy, without prejudice to their rights stipulated in Articles (666) and (732) of the Commercial Code, taking into account what is stated in Article (12) of this law.)

This necessitates the closure of the bankruptcy in accordance with the provisions of Bankruptcy Law No. 71 of 2020 and its executive regulations due to the insufficiency of his bankruptcy funds. Consequently, each creditor regains the right to take individual actions and file individual lawsuits against the bankrupt. The Authority, in its capacity as the bankruptcy trustee, shall be responsible for a period of one year from the date of the bankruptcy closure decision for the documents delivered to it by the creditors.
